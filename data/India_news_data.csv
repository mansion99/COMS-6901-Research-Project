The Times of India,"Obama speaks to Modi on climate sticking points
",,"Just as the climate conference presidency was about to release the first review of the draft Paris agreement, US secretary of state John Kerry kicked off hectic parleys outside the negotiation rooms by first meeting India’s environment minister Prakash Javadekar late on Tuesday night. The meeting was aimed at arriving at a consensus on key issues of finance, equity, differentiation and review mechanism.


Immediately after the meeting, US president Barack Obama called Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss the progress made in the negotiations — an indication that the sticky points were yet to be resolved.
The night’s breakneck activity was followed by Kerry making a strong call to arrive at a “legally binding” deal with a “transparent system” to save the world from disastrous consequences of climate change.
In his maiden speech at the conference, Kerry cited examples of Chennai floods, Beijing’s smog and other extreme weather events to pitch for an agreement.

Referring to the Chennai floods, he said these were “warning signals” that no rational person should ignore, adding that he stood by the victims of the disaster.
Citing other examples from Vietnam to Alaska, he appealed to the representatives of 196 countries to arrive at an effective deal as the on-going summit may be the best chance that “we have to correct the course our planet is on”.
Renewable energy, Kerry said, would go a long way in solving the problem and a successful summit would send a strong signal to markets across the world. Noting the efforts made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi through the International Solar Alliance and Mission Innovation, he said these were remarkable initiatives that would not be a part of the agreement but would complement it in a big way.


Steering clear of the finer details of the negotiations, he made it clear that the US respected the principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibility (CBDR) and respective capabilities of nations, but said his country would like an agreement with a legally binding enforcement system that will reassure investors who have to carry the low-carbon economy beyond what governments can do.
Kerry announced that the US would double its contribution to helping vulnerable nations adapt to climate change impacts, pledging to increase the amount of money it provides for climate adaptation grants to $860 million from $430 million by 2020.
“Today’s commitment to double that figure is a component of an existing commitment by developed countries to jointly mobilize $100 billion per year by 2020 from a wide variety of sources, in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation,” the US state department later said in a statement.
Referring to clean energy technology and on-going efforts worldwide to reduce emission, Kerry in his speech noted that the Paris agreement was not only meant for keeping the world stay within the 2 degree Celsius temperature rise limit but it would also send the marketplace an “extraordinary signal” of commitment to clean energy.
“Make no mistake. If, as a global community, we refuse to rise to this challenge... if we continue to allow calculated obstruction to derail the urgency of this moment... we will be liable for a collective moral failure of historic consequence,” he said.
“We are not just responsible to ourselves — we are responsible to the future generations...our kids and grand kids”, said Kerry",2015 - 12 - 10 
The Times of India,"Ban Ki-moon terms Paris deal 'monumental triumph' for planet Earth
",,"UN chief Ban Ki-moon has termed the historic climate change agreement reached in Paris as a ""monumental triumph"" for planet Earth that will set the stage for achieving an end to poverty and development for all.
""In the face of an unprecedented challenge, you have demonstrated unprecedented leadership,"" the UN secretary general said taking the COP21 stage just minutes after the adoption of the agreement.


""You have worked collaboratively to achieve something that no one nation could achieve alone. This is a resounding success for multilateralism.""
In a landmark deal, 195 Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change pledged to curb emissions, strengthen resilience and take common climate action.

""The Paris Agreement is a monumental triumph for people and our planet,"" Ban said in a tweet, immediately following the adoption of the new Paris Agreement. ""It sets the stage for progress in ending poverty, strengthening peace and ensuring a life of dignity and opportunity for all.""
Recalling that he made climate change one of the defining priorities of his tenure, Ban said that most of all, he has listened to people - the young, the poor and the vulnerable, including indigenous peoples, from every corner of the globe.


""They seek protection from the perils of a warming planet, and the opportunity to live in a safer, more bountiful world,"" he said. ""They have demanded that world leaders act to safeguard their well-being and that of generations to come.""
Turning to the agreement itself, the Secretary-General said negotiators reached ""solid results on all key points,"" with an agreement that demonstrates solidarity and ""is ambitious, flexible, credible and durable.""
""All countries have agreed to hold global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius. And recognizing the risk of grave consequences, you have further agreed to pursue efforts to limit temperature increase to 1.5 degrees,"" he said.
In addition, a review mechanism has been established whereby every five years, beginning in 2018, Parties will regularly review what is needed in line with science.
""Governments have agreed to binding, robust, transparent rules of the road to ensure that all countries do what they have agreed across a range of issues,"" Ban added.
""When historians look back on this day, they will say that global cooperation to secure a future safe from climate change took a dramatic new turn here in Paris,"" Ban said.
""Today, we can look into the eyes of our children and grandchildren, and we can finally say, tell them that we have joined hands to bequeath a more habitable world to them and to future generations.""

The Times of India,"Paris pact not enough to save the world
",,"Civil society groups and green think-tanks from South Asia did not appear too enthused with the Paris agreement which, they said, was not ambitious enough to save the world from disastrous consequences of climate change.
After going through the fine print of the global climate agreement, New Delhi-based think-tank Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) said it was a compromise deal and in many ways it could be termed “lowest minimum denominator”.


Climate Action Network South Asia (CANSA), a coalition of over 141 civil society groups from South Asia, on the other hand, called the agreement “durable and dynamic” but said it had fallen short of being fully fair and responsive to future needs.
CSE noted the developing countries had got “words” and promises of money while developed countries had finally got rid of their historical responsibility of causing climate change. The think-tank said rich nations had no legally binding targets on quantum of finance ($100 billion) or emissions cuts. The phrase ‘historical responsibility’ has been erased from the agreement and this weakens the obligations of developed countries to take actions due to their past emissions. Without historical responsibility, equity will now be interpreted only through the words ‘respective capabilities and national circumstances’, further removing differentiation between the climate actions of developed and developing countries,” Chandra Bhushan, deputy director general of CSE, said.


“To erase any notion of historical responsibility, the developed countries have gone to the extent of mentioning in the text that the loss and damage due to climate change does not involve or provide a basis for any liability or compensation,” he added.
CSE also feared that the deal would put the world on a path of 3 degrees Celsius and above of global warming as not much enhancement in ambition would happen for the next 10 years. It said the developed countries had not committed any significant finance or emission cuts before 2020.
“On the whole, the draft Paris agreement continues to be weak and unambitious, as it does not include any meaningful targets for developed countries to reduce their emissions. It notes that climate injustice is a concern of some and it maintains that the agreement will be under the UN convention. But as it does not operationalise equity and the term carbon budget didn’t even find mention in the text, this will end up furthering climate apartheid,” Sunita Narain, director general of CSE, said.
Sanjay Vashist, director of CANSA, said, “The onus is now on developed countries to fulfill their promises and scale up climate finance flows to support mitigation and adaptation efforts, especially for most vulnerable countries.”",2015 - 12 - 14
The Times of India,"PM Narendra Modi on Paris deal: Climate justice won
",,"Shortly after a climate change deal was reached by 195 nations in Paris, Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the historic accord, saying ""climate justice has won"".
""Outcome of Paris agreement has no winners or losers. Climate justice has won and we are all working towards a greener future,"" he tweeted from his personal handle.
Modi said the agreement demonstrated the ""collective wisdom"" of world leaders to mitigate climate change.

""Climate change remains a challenge but Paris agreement demonstrates how every nation rose to the challenge, working towards a solution,"" he said in another tweet.
The historic agreement in Paris signed by 195 countries was reached after tough deliberations for more than two weeks. Modi had visited Paris for the inauguration of the Conference of Parties or COP21, as the climate summit was known.

Just before the 31-page document was finalised, French President François Hollande, who hosted the conference, called up Modi to apprise him of the latest status at the talks.

The Times of India,"India is not happy with the first draft text of the Paris agreement on climate change, Javadekar says
",,"India on Wednesday expressed disappointment over the first draft text of the Paris climate change agreement, which was presented to the governments two days ago, and said the country's negotiators would submit suggestions during the next round of negotiations at Bonn.
In his first reaction to the draft text that completely ignores the crucial issue of 'equity' and transparency of action, environment and climate change minister Prakash Javadekarsaid, ""I would like to underline that the first draft text of the Paris agreement is quite disappointing.

It does not inspire.""
He told the TOI that he was not at all happy with the text.
The draft agreement is a concise basis for negotiations for the next session from October 19-23 in Bonn. Co-Chairs Ahmed Djoghlaf of Algeria and Daniel Reifsnyder of the US prepared the draft in response to a request from countries to have a better basis from which to negotiate.

Without going into the details of the text and India's specific objections, Javadekar said, ""We should certainly have a different text for the Paris meet to become a success. Our negotiators will submit India's suggestions. Other countries will also come out with their suggestions.
""This is, after all, not a final text. I hope that there will be more moderated and justifiable text on table after Bonn and other pre-COP (conference of parties) negotiations. I wish the things will improve in the run-up to Paris.""


Countries are committed to reaching the new agreement at the UN Climate Change Conference to be held in Paris in December this year.
It is learnt that besides its strong objection to an apparent attempt by the co-chairs to dilute the element of 'equity', India is also not happy with the review of greenhouse gas emission every five years. India has consistently been demanding that the Paris agreement must be equitable so that it can deliver justice.
Many nations, including developing countries like India, want reviews only once every decade, or only for developed countries.
The draft text has also not clearly dealt with the renewable energy issues nor does it specifically mention of a key deforestation mitigation program under REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) plus scheme which creates financial value for carbon stored in trees as an incentive for developing countries to reduce emissions.",2015 - 10 - 12
The Times of India,"Paris climate deal should reflect differentiated responsibilities
",,"The developing countries' bloc of Brazil, South Africa, India and China have underscored that the ambitious Paris Agreement on climate change to be adopted later this year should ""fully reflect"" differentiated responsibilities of developed and developing countries.
Developed countries should take the lead by undertaking ambitious emission reduction targets, ministers from the BASIC (Brazil, South Africa, India, China) bloc said as they met for the 20th Ministerial Meeting on Climate Change here over the weekend.


India was represented by Joint Secretary in the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change Ravi Prasad along with Brazil's Minister for the Environment Izabella Teixeira, South African Minister of Environmental Affairs Edna Molewa and Special Representative for Climate Change Affairs of China Xie Zhenhua.
In a joint statement issued after the ministerial, the ministers underscored the need for the Paris Agreement to address in a balanced manner all six elements identified in the Durban mandate - mitigation, adaptation, finance, capacity-building, technology development and transfer, transparency of action and support.

In this regard, they stressed that an ambitious outcome of the ADP (Durban Platform for Enhanced Action) should not focus solely on mitigation, but should also address the other elements in a balanced and comprehensive manner.
""With regards to mitigation, Ministers underscored the need for the provisions of the agreement to fully reflect differentiated responsibilities and distinct development stages of developed and developing countries, with developed countries taking the lead by undertaking ambitious, economy- wide, absolute emission reduction targets and providing finance and technology support to developing countries,"" the statement said.


It added that developing countries will also enhance their efforts, in the context of sustainable development, enabled and supported by finance, technology development and transfer and capacity-building from developed countries.",2015 - 06 - 29
The Times of India,"India and Germany sign mega green deal ahead of Paris agreement
",,"NEW DELHI: Recognizing ""renewable energy"" and ""efficient use of energy"" as most effective routes to mitigate climate-damaging greenhouse gas emissions, India and Germany on Monday decided to move on this path more aggressively under new 'India-German Climate and Renewable Alliance' and identified seven focus areas to intensify their ongoing cooperation.
Germany, on its part, will provide soft loans worth one billion Euros to India over the next five years in addition to 1.15 billion Euros that Berlin had committed earlier under 'Green Energy Corridors Partnership'.


The alliance will be a comprehensive partnership to harness ""technology, innovation and finance"" in order to make affordable, clean and renewable energy accessible to all and to foster climate change mitigation efforts in both countries.
Interestingly, both the countries also underlined that ""adaptation"" must be a central part of a balanced Paris climate agreement – the point which has consistently been raised by India despite being resisted by many rich nations who want a mitigation-centric deal.

The agreement on renewable energy, signed between India and Germany, is perfectly in tune with what New Delhi had promised in its 'climate action plan' (called Intended Nationally Determined Contribution - INDC) last week.
India had told the UN body on climate change on October 1 that the country would increase its share of clean energy by nearly 40% of its total energy mix by the year 2030, provided it gets support of finance and technology from the developed countries. New Delhi also highlighted that the country would need $ 2.5 trillion for this purpose by 2030.


This is where the new 'India-German Climate and Renewable Alliance' will come as a boost for India's efforts to move on low carbon growth path. Prime Minister Narendra Modi too flagged this issue in his statement at joint press briefing with visiting German chancellor Angela Merkel here on Monday while recognizing German's cooperation.
He said, ""I admire German leadership in clean energy and commitment to combating climate change. This is an area where we have convergence of views, and rapidly growing cooperation. We have agreed on India-Germany Climate and Renewable Alliance with a long term vision and a comprehensive agenda of combating climate change.
""I place great value on Germany's assistance of over one billion Euros for India's Green Energy Corridor and a new assistance package of over a billion Euros for solar projects in India"".
Both the countries also decided to explore opportunities in enhancing cooperation in the field of ""climate risk insurance"" – an area which is expected to get new focus in the wake of a global climate deal in Paris in December.
Referring to the possible outcome of the Paris climate deal, both India and Germany reaffirmed that ""the protocol, another legal instrument or agreed outcome with legal force under the (UN) Convention applicable to all Parties (countries)"" will address in a balanced manner all key elements like mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity-building, and transparency of action and support.
India has consistently been pitching for any such agreement in future that must recognize all these elements under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
Underlining joint efforts of countries to address issues concerning climate change, both India and Germany also launched an 'India-German Working Group on Climate Change' under the India-German Environment Forum.
Both the countries ""regularly discuss climate policy and exchange views with regard to India's and Germany's transition to low-carbon economies and associated co-benefits for sustainable development"" under the Forum.
Modi and Merkel also agreed that state and city level entities should be supported to harness new technologies, policies, financing mechanisms, and economic incentives to reduce emissions.
""India and Germany will work together to develop and implement solutions that strengthen climate friendly urban development, including, inter alia, through initiatives in energy transition in cities, climate friendly urban mobility, energy efficiency in the housing sector, energy efficiency in urban water supply as well as recycling and waste management in major Indian cities"", said the joint statement.
Acknowledging that climate change responses and solutions generate new opportunities and co-benefits by creating jobs, spurring economic development and improving air quality, both the countries agreed to intensify their ongoing cooperation on climate and renewables technology under the new Indo-German Climate and Renewables Alliance.
The alliance will have seven focus areas: Next generation solar technology, Renewable energy storage, Climate-friendly space cooling technologies, Super-efficient appliances and buildings, Zero emission passenger and freight vehicles, energy-efficient rail and water infrastructure and offshore wind.
Prime Minister Modi, in the joint statement, emphasized India's ongoing efforts to create a market environment that will promote trade and investment in climate technology.",2015 - 10 - 05
The Times of India,"Paris accord offers hope but could have done more: India
",,"PARIS: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday welcomed the climate change agreement as the victory of “climate justice” and said there were no winners or losers even as environment minister Prakash Javadekar said 196 countries had not only adopted an agreement but a “new chapter of hope” in the lives of 7 billion people across the globe. The minister, however, added that the agreement could have been “more ambitious”.
“Outcome of Paris Agreementhas no winners or losers.

Climate justice has won and we are all working towards a greener future,” Modi tweeted. “Climate change remains a challenge but Paris Agreement demonstrates how every nation rose to the challenge, working towards a solution,” he added. “Deliberations at COP21 and Paris Agreement demonstrate the collective wisdom of world leaders to mitigate climate change,” the PM said in another tweet.

Earlier, addressing the closing plenary of the climate summit that continued for hours after final adoption of the agreement, Javadekar, who was India’s head of delegation, said, “The Paris agreement acknowledges and recognizes the development imperatives of India and other developing countries.” India, however, had some concerns over the deal, much like Turkey, Nicaragua and other countries including small island nations. “We share the concern of several friends that this agreement does not put us on the path to prevent temperature rise below 2 degree (Celsius) and that the actions of developed countries are far below their historical responsibilities and fair shares,” Javadekar said.


Noting that give and take was normal in negotiations, the minister said, “We are of the opinion that the agreement could have been more ambitious.” He also emphasized that India in a “spirit of compromise agreed on a number of phrases in the agreement”. Referring to points which India agreed to in the deal, Javadekar said, “We are happy that the agreement has unequivocally acknowledged the imperative of climate justice -- which we have no doubts reflects common sentiments -- and has based itself on the principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities. The agreement also acknowledges the importance of sustainable lifestyles and sustainable consumption pattern.”
Later, he told reporters, “I hope that the commitments made are fulfilled. This will be new beginning. Paris has succeeded. It was under terror attack last month. This month, Paris has proved that the world comes together and that is the answer to mitigate the challenge posed by climate change.”
Asked about the compromises on points like mitigation, finance and loss and damage, Javadekar said, “When 196 countries are putting their efforts together, you need to be accommodative without changing the thrust of the agreement. We have done everything to maintain the thrust.”
The question was asked in the context of excluding quantum of finance ($100 billion) from the legal part of the text and giving room to developed countries while replacing the word “shall” (compulsory) with “should” (not mandatory) in the approved text in terms of their mitigation (emission cut) actions. The closing plenary was told that the replacement was needed as it was a typo in the final negotiation text.
On the next course of action, Javadekar said, “It will be continuous work from here till 2020 to have a new mechanism. At the same time, all nations are bound by the INDCs and they will be reporting (their climate actions to the UN body).”
Calling the climate summit an “absolute success”, he said, “We are also happy that the agreement differentiates between the actions of developed and developing countries across its elements (mitigation, adaptation, finance, technology transfer, capacity building and transparency). India has consistently said that the path to climate ambition must be paved with equity. I am happy that the agreement has recognized this.” ",2015 - 12 - 14
The Times of India,"India expresses concerns over the draft of Paris agreement
",,"PARIS: Hours after the French presidency of the climate summit (COP21) came out with the first draft of the Paris agreement, India on Wednesday said that there were ""many points of departure"" in the text and much work was needed to reach a point of convergence.
The biggest group of 134 developing countries - G77 and China - too expressed similar concerns over the 29-page draft text and pointed out specific issues where negotiators need to converge in the next 48 hours to get a fair and effective climate deal.


Besides raising its concerns over the draft text, India also associated itself with the statements made on behalf of G77. India is part of this group.
Articulating India's view on the text, the country's environment minister Prakash Javadekar during the Paris Committee meeting here on late Wednesday night said, ""The latest draft is a starting point for our final push. But at this stage there are many points of departure. Much work is needed to reach a point of convergence"".

Listing the country's specific concerns, Javadekar in his statement said, ""The agreement that we are crafting must carefully balance climate ambition and the principle of differentiation. Both are equally important. We cannot have one without the other.
""It needs to be reaffirmed upfront in the agreement that it is under the Convention and in accordance with its principles. Its objective is to enhance the implementation of the Convention across all its pillars. This is crucial"".


Stating that the principles of the Convention must be stated correctly without any unnecessary additions, he emphasised that the agreement must also meaningfully operationalize differentiation across all its elements.
""This is not clear in the current draft"", he noted.
Showing flexibility on the part of India to reach a climate deal here, the minister said, ""Let me be clear. We are not suggesting that we remain stuck to the past. Surely, we must look forward and move steadily.
""But a durable agreement cannot be crafted by diluting historical responsibilities or by putting the polluters and the victims at the same level"".
He also stressed that the concept of INDCs is a great innovation and has proved a game-changer. ""It has enabled the participation of over 186 countries. Yet, INDCs are not even mentioned in the draft"", said Javadekar.
Referring to the long-term temperature goal where many countries, mainly the small island nations, have been insisting for staying within the 1.5 degree Celsius temperature rise limit instead of striving for staying within the 2 degree Celsius rise limit, the minister said India was ""deeply sensitive to the demands for higher climate ambition"".
He said, ""I understand fully the demand for mentioning 1.5 degrees (in the text), as we also have over 1300 islands in India. However, a 1.5 degree goal would require developed countries to massively reduce their emissions and massively ‘scale up’ their financial support to developing countries. This is not happening"".
Placing the country's demand in the text, the minister said, ""India is in favour of a robust transparency mechanism. This should apply not just to mitigation but all other elements, in particular finance.
""The transparency mechanism should cover all countries, in a differentiated manner. Implementing the current system – which has not yet been made operational – is an essential component to build capacity and experience in developing countries. A transition period is therefore needed before changes could be made"".
On the issue of climate finance where rich countries have to contribute money to the Green Climate Fund to help out poor and developing countries for their adaptation efforts, the minister said that it was ""deeply disappointing"" that on the one hand developed countries were not fulfilling their obligations and on the other hand, they were trying to shift their responsibilities to developing countries themselves.
""There is no indication of scaling up of finance nor a clear roadmap"", he said.
Highlighting these key points from India's perspective, the minister said, ""We also find that several of our other concerns, such as unilateral measures, sustainable lifestyles and climate justice do not find a mention in the draft. We will examine the draft carefully and engage with all our partners to reach an agreement"".",2015 - 12 - 10
The Times of India,New version of the draft Paris agreement released,,"PARIS: The French presidency of the COP21 (21st conference of parties) on Thursday night came out with a new and slight shorter version of the draft text of the Paris agreement. The 27-page draft text, comprises of all the key issues as options, will now be placed before the negotiators for night-long negotiation. A final draft of the proposed climate deal will thereafter be released on Friday. The new text incorporates India's demand of recognising sustainable lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production in dealing with the threats of climate change. The Para 16 of the draft agreement specifically refers to these points while flagging that the developed countries would take the lead and play an important role in addressing the climate change.
India had long been demanding insertion of lifestyle issue in the agreement ever since the Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a strong pitch for it. Even the country's environment minister Prakash Javadekar had on Wednesday night made this point during the Paris Committee meeting while reacting on the first draft text. As compared to 366 brackets and 47 options in Wednesday's draft, the new draft is quite an improved version with having only 50 brackets and 13 options -- it means the negotiators have been able to resolve many differences in the language of the text.
The concerns of the developing countries including India are there in the new version so that they can go to the negotiation with their options on differentiation, finance, stocktake and long-term goal intact.
If the countries will be able to seal the deal here in Paris, it will be signed in New York on April 22, 2016. The UN secretary general will invite the world leaders for the high-level signing ceremony.
According to the new draft, the first stocktake on country's climate action will take place in 2019 and thereafter every five years. It also says that the countries will be ""invited"" to resubmit their Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC).
Since it categorically says that the countries will update and enhance their proposed actions in a ""nationally determined manner"", it will probably address the concerns of those countries who are opposed to this idea of review every five years.
All these issues will be discussed in the plenary which is convened at 11.30 PM Paris time (4 AM IST). After releasing the new version, the French foreign minister and COP21 president Laurent Fabius gave countries' negotiations a little over two hours of time to go through it and come out with their suggestions so that he would be able to come out with the final text on Friday.
As far as higher climate ambition is concerned, the temperature goal text refers to the well below 2 degree Celsius above pre-industrial level limit and even mentions the idea of pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degree Celsius.
As part of the long term goal, the text mentions reaching the greenhouse gas emissions neutrality in the second half of the century.
Though there is a whole article on the Loss and Damage, it carries a wide range of options -- meaning the negotiators will have to really find a common ground through hard negotiations specifically when rich nations are not much keen on the issue.

Hindustan Times,Efforts insufficient to attain Paris agreement goals: UN,,"New Delhi: Even if nations meet all of their current climate commitments, submitted as nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement, the 1.5 degrees C global warming threshold will be breached, a new UN report said on Tuesday.

The report flagged that global efforts to lower emissions are insufficient to meet Paris Agreement goals but has also found that peaking of global emissions are likely to happen during this decade by 2030. The report is a wake-up call for nations ahead of the UN Climate Meeting (COP28) scheduled to be held in Dubai next month.

If the latest NDCs are implemented, emissions will increase by about 8.8% by 2030, compared to 2010 levels. This is a marginal improvement over last year's assessment, which found countries were on a path to increase emissions 10.6% by 2030, compared to 2010 levels. That is wholly inadequate: the latest science from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicates that greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut 43% by 2030, compared to 2019 levels. This is critical to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels and avoid the worst impacts of climate change, including more frequent and severe droughts, heatwaves and rainfall.

The NDC Synthesis report released on Tuesday also reveals that global emissions will peak this decade; by 2030 emissions are projected to be 2% below 2019 levels, highlighting that peaking of global emissions will occur.

The report released Tuesday synthesizes information from the 168 latest available NDCs, representing 195 Parties to the Paris Agreement, including 153 new or updated NDCs communicated by 180 Parties, recorded in the NDC registry as on 25 September.

""The world is failing to get a grip on the climate crisis. That is the message of the UNFCCC's latest report which provides yet more evidence that the world remains massively off track to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and avoiding the worst of climate catastrophe. As the report shows, global ambition stagnated over the past year and national climate plans are strikingly misaligned with the science,"" said UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres in a statement.

A second UN report on long-term low-emission development strategies, also released on Tuesday, looked at countries' plans to transition to net-zero emissions by or around mid-century.

The report indicated that these countries' greenhouse gas emissions could be roughly 63% lower in 2050 than in 2019, if all the long-term strategies are fully implemented on time. Current long-term strategies (only 75 Parties to the Paris Agreement have submitted these) account for 87% of the world's GDP, 68% of global population in 2019, and around 77% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2019. The report notes, however, that many net-zero targets remain uncertain and postpone into the future critical action that needs to take place now.

Referring to the first report, Simon Stiell , Executive-Secretary of UN Climate Change said in a statement: ""Today's report shows that governments combined are taking baby steps to avert the climate crisis. And it shows why governments must make bold strides forward at COP28 in Dubai, to get on track.""

Stiell stressed that the conclusion of the first global stocktake at COP28 is where nations can regain momentum to scale up their efforts to get on track with meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. The stocktake is intended to inform the next round of NDCs to be put forward by 2025, paving the way for accelerated action.

India formally updated its NDC last year, confirming to the United Nations apex body that it will reduce the emissions intensity of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 45% from 2005 levels by the year 2030, and to have installed capacity for non-fossil fuel-based power sources equivalent to the country's 50% requirement by 2030.

India has also submitted its long-term climate action strategy at the UN Climate Conference (COP27) joining a select list of countries that have articulated how they will achieve their net zero emissions goal in the long-term.

The country's Long-Term Low-Carbon Development Strategy mainly articulates India's vision and action plan for achieving its NDC goals and the target of net zero emissions by 2070 and key elements of India's transition to a low-carbon development pathway.

Global efforts to limit warming to 1.5 degree C are failing across the board. They are moving on the right direction but not at sufficient speed, the State of Climate Action 2023 report also said on Tuesday.

Only one of 42 indicators for meeting the 1.5 degree C goal is on track which is electric passenger car sales, as per the report.

The report jointly published by Bezos Earth Fund, Climate Action Tracker (a project of Climate Analytics and NewClimate Institute), ClimateWorks Foundation, the United Nations Climate Change High-Level Champions and World Resources Institute (WRI) states that 6 indicators are ""off track,"" moving in the right direction at a promising but insufficient speed; 24 indicators are ""well off track,"" heading in the right direction but well below the required pace; 6 indicators are headed in the wrong direction entirely, such that a U-turn in action is required and 5 indicators have insufficient data to track progress.

The share of solar and wind technologies in electricity generation has grown by an annual average of 14% in recent years, but this needs to reach 24% to get on track for 2030. Phase out coal in electricity generation needs to be 7 times faster than current rates. This is equivalent to retiring roughly 240 average-sized coal-fired power plants each year through 2030. Rapid transit infrastructure needs to be expanded six times faster. This is equivalent to constructing public transit systems roughly three times the size of New York City's network of subway rails, bus lanes and light-rail tracks each year throughout this decade.

The report flagged that global efforts to lower emissions are insufficient to meet Paris Agreement goals but has also found that peaking of global emissions are likely to happen during this decade by 2030. The report is a wake-up call for nations ahead of the UN Climate Meeting (COP28) scheduled to be held in Dubai next month.

If the latest NDCs are implemented, emissions will increase by about 8.8% by 2030, compared to 2010 levels. This is a marginal improvement over last year's assessment, which found countries were on a path to increase emissions 10.6% by 2030, compared to 2010 levels. That is wholly inadequate: the latest science from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) indicates that greenhouse gas emissions need to be cut 43% by 2030, compared to 2019 levels. This is critical to limit temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels and avoid the worst impacts of climate change, including more frequent and severe droughts, heatwaves and rainfall.

The NDC Synthesis report released on Tuesday also reveals that global emissions will peak this decade; by 2030 emissions are projected to be 2% below 2019 levels, highlighting that peaking of global emissions will occur.

The report synthesizes information from the 168 latest available NDCs, representing 195 Parties to the Paris Agreement, including 153 new or updated NDCs communicated by 180 Parties, recorded in the NDC registry as of 25 September.

""The world is failing to get a grip on the climate crisis. That is the message of the UNFCCC's latest report which provides yet more evidence that the world remains massively off track to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius and avoiding the worst of climate catastrophe. As the report shows, global ambition stagnated over the past year and national climate plans are strikingly misaligned with the science,"" said UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres in a statement.

A second UN report on long-term low-emission development strategies, also released on Tuesday, looked at countries' plans to transition to net-zero emissions by or around mid-century.

The report indicated that these countries' greenhouse gas emissions could be roughly 63% lower in 2050 than in 2019 if all the long-term strategies are fully implemented on time. Current long-term strategies (only 75 Parties to the Paris Agreement have submitted these) account for 87% of the world's GDP, 68% of the global population in 2019, and around 77% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2019. The report noted, however, that many net-zero targets remain uncertain and postpone the future critical action that needs to take place now.

Referring to the first report, Simon Stiell, Executive-Secretary of UN Climate Change said in a statement: ""Today's report shows that governments combined are taking baby steps to avert the climate crisis. And it shows why governments must make bold strides forward at COP28 in Dubai, to get on track.""

Stiell stressed that the conclusion of the first global stocktake at COP28 is where nations can regain momentum to scale up their efforts to get on track with meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. The stocktake is intended to inform the next round of NDCs to be put forward by 2025, paving the way for accelerated action.

India formally updated its NDC last year, confirming to the United Nations apex body that it will reduce the emissions intensity of its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 45% from 2005 levels by the year 2030, and to have installed capacity for non-fossil fuel-based power sources equivalent to the country's 50% requirement by 2030.

India has also submitted its long-term climate action strategy at the UN Climate Conference (COP27) joining a select list of countries that have articulated how they will achieve their net zero emissions goal in the long-term.

The country's Long-Term Low-Carbon Development Strategy mainly articulates India's vision and action plan for achieving its NDC goals and the target of net zero emissions by 2070 and key elements of India's transition to a low-carbon development pathway.

State of Climate Action 2023

The State of Climate Action 2023 report, also released on Tuesday, also emphasised the limited impact of the steps being taken. The report said the global efforts to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C were failing across the board. The steps were in the right direction but were not at sufficient speed, the report said, stressing that only one of the 42 indicators - electric passenger car sales -- was on track.

The report, which was jointly published by Bezos Earth Fund, Climate Action Tracker (a project of Climate Analytics and NewClimate Institute), ClimateWorks Foundation, the United Nations Climate Change High-Level Champions and World Resources Institute (WRI) said that 6 indicators are ""off track"", moving in the right direction at a promising but insufficient speed; 24 indicators are ""well off track"", heading in the right direction but well below the required pace; 6 indicators are headed in the wrong direction and require a U-turn and 5 indicators have insufficient data to track progress.

The share of solar and wind technologies in electricity generation has grown by an annual average of 14% in recent years, but this needs to reach 24% to get on track for 2030. Phasing out coal in electricity generation needs to be 7 times faster than current rates and is equivalent to retiring roughly 240 average-sized coal-fired power plants each year through 2030. Rapid transit infrastructure needs to be expanded six times faster. This is equivalent to constructing public transit systems roughly three times the size of New York City's network of subway rails, bus lanes and light-rail tracks each year throughout this decade. The annual rate of deforestation -- equivalent to deforesting 15 football (soccer) fields per minute in 2022 -- needs to be reduced four times faster over this decade, the report said.",2023-11-14T14:27:49Z
The Times of India,"India slams rich nations' climate efforts; calls for focus on pre-2020 gaps, equity in Global Stocktake | India News - Times of India","TIMESOFINDIA COM, Sep","NEW DELHI: India has said that the first-ever Global Stocktake - a periodic review of efforts towards meeting Paris Agreement goals - outcome should prioritise addressing pre-2020 gaps, capture equity as an overarching concern, and acknowledge the serious lack of ambition among developed nations in combating climate change.

With developed countries responsible for most of the carbon utilisation historically and at present, India stressed that developing countries need their share in the ""atmosphere"" to enable them to meet their development goals.

Global Stocktake is a two-year UN review to evaluate collective global progress towards achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement. Started in Glasgow in 2021, this process will conclude at the end of the annual climate talks in Dubai in December.

In a submission to the UNFCCC outlining its expectations from the Global Stocktake, India emphasised that the outcome should encourage developed nations to reduce their emissions in alignment with their historical responsibilities and provide support to developing countries in terms of finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity building.

The Global Stocktake outcome must promote global climate action within the context of poverty eradication, sustainable development, economic diversification efforts, and closing gaps in social and economic development between developed and developing countries, India emphasised.

It stressed that the First Global Stocktake outcome should not exclusively focus on future mitigation while disregarding ""historical responsibility and pre-2020 emissions.""

""Pre-2020 is the foundation upon which climate action must be built, and as such, pre-2020 gaps should be addressed as a matter of priority with a view to advancing long-term climate action and protecting the integrity of the Paris Agreement.

""It is an iterative process. There is a need to reaffirm the objectives, principles, and provisions of the Convention, in particular the principles of equity and CBDR-RC, keeping in view the process of enhanced action in the Pre-2020 period,"" it said.

The principle of equity ensures that countries' efforts to combat climate change are viewed in light of their contributions to greenhouse gas emissions, both in past and present, as well as emissions they are likely to generate in future.

The CBDR-RC principle recognises that each country bears responsibility for addressing climate change, but developed countries should shoulder primary responsibilities, given their significant historical and current greenhouse gas emissions.

India also made it clear that it does not support any other classification of developing countries, such as ""major emitters"", ""G20 partners"", and ""other developing and emerging economies"", as these classifications overlook national circumstances and replace considerations of ""equity and CBDR-RC"" in terms of climate actions.

India stressed the need to acknowledge the gap between the equitable share of the global carbon space allocated to developing countries and the physical share accessible to them ""because Annex-I countries have historically and presently consumed disproportionately vast proportions of the allotted carbon budget.""

Climate science defines carbon budget as the amount of greenhouse gases that can be emitted for a given level of global warming.

When developed countries take more than their fair share of the carbon budget, India said, it means they're responsible for a big part of the damages from global warming because they're emitting too much.

The Global Stocktake should also acknowledge that equity can only be achieved if developing countries are granted access to technology, finance, and development space, it said.

""Equity can only be achieved if the loss of equitably allowed carbon space for developing nations is made up by providing access to technology and finance. Countries which have enjoyed carbon budgets before are not reducing emissions at the same scale which allows a just distribution of the carbon budget.

""The outcome should record that equity in GST will provide development space and carbon space to developing countries,"" the submission read.

India argued that the Global Stocktake outcome must acknowledge the significant lack of ambition among Annex-I parties, evident from the gaps in the Pre-Paris era regarding mitigation and its implications for the mitigation burden after 2020.

It should also provide ""science-based information"" on whether Annex-I countries are on a low-carbon and climate-resilient pathway or if they require course correction.

""For instance, have Annex-I countries invested in low-carbon and low-emissions development technologies?"" India asked.

India pointed out that the large volume of historical emissions by Annex I Parties, beyond their equitable share in cumulative emissions by any measure, cannot be ignored.

Climate change is measured in terms of cumulative historical emissions from 1850 to the present day. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is estimated to be 415 parts per million and global temperatures have already risen 1.1 degrees Celsius over pre-industrial levels.

""However, all countries have not contributed to this rise,"" India said.

The Paris Agreement recognises that developed countries most responsible for greenhouse gas emissions must support developing countries in line with their historical responsibility.

Countries of the global north are responsible for the largest percentage of cumulative overshoot in emissions historically, it said.

""The UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) placed responsibility on developed and developing countries for actions on the basis of historical emissions and the principles of equity and CBDR-RC (Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities).

""The Convention mandates developed countries to support climate change actions in developing countries taking into account their historical and current contribution to the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere,"" it explained.

India argued that equal sharing of the mitigation burden between developed and developing countries is unfair and inequitable when accounting for their respective responsibilities for atmospheric GHG concentrations.

It is unfair for those who have contributed the most to the problem not to contribute more to the solution than those whose contribution is much smaller. Similarly, in the face of a problem demanding a collective solution, it would be unfair to expect those with fewer resources to commit a higher share to the solution of the problem.

""Since the developed countries lead in their current and historical levels of energy consumption and emissions, therefore they must also lead in their efforts in addressing issues arising from and pertaining to climate change. The GST (Global Stocktake) outcome must reflect greater detailing of this issue in particular,"" India said.

A technical report on the Global Stocktake published by the UNFCCC earlier this month noted with concern that the world is way off the track to meet the long-term goals of the Paris Agreement.

The report underscored the need for climate action to be rooted in justice and equity, saying that the burden of climate impacts falls disproportionately on developing countries, making equity a central concern.

It said that climate finance remains a central enabler for climate action, particularly in developing countries.",2023-09-29T15:00:11Z
Hindustan Times,Climate meet in Glasgow: Tense final hours at COP26 amid tough stands on deal,,"China and India, the world's first- and third-biggest emitters, put up a tough stance to the most ambitious parts of the final agreement in Glasgow. India objected to the point of asking countries to shift away from fossil fuels.

Consensus eluded the 196 parties at the Glasgow climate change conference (COP26) on Saturday after developed and developing nations remained deeply divided over the third Cover Decision Text released by the COP26 presidency, with India being one of those that maintained a tough stand on the issue.

While the deliberations appeared to be tentatively heading for a deal that conference host Britain said would keep alive a goal of capping global warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius to maintain a realistic chance of avoiding catastrophe, tensions spilled into the open as the talks came down to the wire.

China and India, the world's first- and third-biggest emitters, put up a tough stance to the most ambitious parts of the final agreement in Glasgow. India objected to the point of asking countries to shift away from fossil fuels. The two nations flagged that the draft text lacked balance, differentiation, and equity.

The red lines were on the issues of compensating loss and damage, mobilising climate mitigation and adaptation finance by developed countries for developing nations.

Late on Saturday, many nations said that in the spirit of compromise, they may endorse the third draft text even if they did not agree with most aspects of the draft.

COP26 was to close on Friday evening but negotiations stretched overnight, with deep divergences that couldn't be resolved even as COP26 president Alok Sharma insisted ""parties have different priorities, but we have to sign up to the same view. We have reached a comprehensive, balanced outcome. The text is now clear of brackets and is a result of a transparent, party driven process"".

Following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report in August flagging that 1.5 degrees Celsius global warming threshold is likely to be breached in the next 10 to 20 years, COP26 was being seen as the last chance to keep the 1.5 degrees C goal in reach through an ambitious and equitable agreement in Glasgow. But on Saturday, even after two weeks of negotiations and very ambitious pledges by world leaders during the Leaders' Summit on November 1 and 2, very serious concerns and differences remained.

Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav, head of the Indian delegation, made an intervention on inequitable aspects of the draft text. ""Consensus has remained elusive. Climate friendly lifestyles and climate justice is enshrined in the Paris Agreement are key to solving the climate crisis. The crisis is caused by unsustainable lifestyles and wasteful consumption patterns. The world needs to awaken to this reality,"" he said, adding that ""fossil fuels and their use has enabled parts of the world to attain high levels of wealth and wellbeing... when we have taken economy wide targets, targeting any particular sector is uncalled for.""

""Every country will arrive at net zero as per its own national circumstances. Developing countries have a right to the fair share of the global carbon budget and are entitled to responsible use of fossil fuels in such scope. In such a situation how can one expect developing countries to make promises of phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies?""

Yadav said that towards poverty eradication, subsidies to certain fossil fuels provide much-needed social security and support. ""We are giving subsidies for LPG to low-income households. This subsidy has been a great help in eliminating biomass burning for cooking, improved health and reduction in indoor pollution. There is a lack of balance in the text - text between finance and mitigation sections. Mitigation section includes annual ministerial-level roundtables, annual NDC (nationally determined contributions) synthesis reports and new long term strategy synthesis reports, request for revisiting NDCs in 2020 etc, none of the same urgency in convening high level meetings or annual reports or progress in meeting finance needs is mentioned.""

""The cover decision should not introduce extraneous elements in the Paris Agreement process. There is well-defined cycle for submission of NDCs already. We don't need to overwrite the agreement with cover decisions by presidency bodies,"" Yadav said, referring to the draft provision to submit new improved NDC by 2022.

China also said the text was by no means perfect but it said it was willing to engage with other parties on concerns with the text. China insisted the expressions in the G20 statement on climate can be reflected in the Glasgow cover text. Guinea, on behalf of G77 and China, raised concerns with the weak provisions on loss and damage.

Bolivia, speaking on behalf of the Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC), said it has deep concerns with the draft text but they are able to support the document and move forward in the spirit of compromise.

Expectedly, the developed countries endorsed the text and called for it to be adopted. ""Don't kill this moment by asking for more texts, different texts, deleting this, deleting that: everyone's been heard by the presidency over the last months. So I implore you: please embrace this text so we can bring hope to the hearts of our children and grandchildren,"" said Frans Timmermans, executive vice-president of the European Commission in-charge of the European Green Deal.

US special envoy on climate John Kerry said the China-US deal in Glasgow showed that despite conflict, countries can come together on the climate crisis, reach above conflict and differences to find common ground. ""Not everyone in public life gets to make choices about life and death and affect an entire planet. We are here to do exactly this..., we are here to ratify this, accept this (draft)."" The US seemed to indicate that it will try to provide adaptation finance through other mechanisms.",2021-11-13T18:37:00Z
Hindustan Times,Charting a sustainable course: The green credits journey,,"India's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have surged significantly in recent years due to a rapidly expanding population and a booming economy, making India the third-largest contributor to GHG emissions globally. To mitigate the growing environmental concern, the Green Credits programme has emerged as a pivotal initiative to promote sustainability and combat climate change.

The Green Credits programme is a revolutionary concept revolving around the idea of quantifying and trading environmental benefits. It allows individuals, organisations, and governments to invest in and support initiatives that reduce greenhouse gas emissions conserve natural resources and promote sustainable practises. Green Credits can take various forms, such as carbon credits, renewable energy certificates, and water quality credits. These credits represent tangible evidence of positive environmental actions.

The Green Credits programme plays a pivotal role in advancing sustainability. By placing a financial value on environmentally friendly actions, it incentivises individuals and businesses to prioritise sustainability in their operations. This not only leads to a reduction in carbon emissions and resource consumption but also fosters innovation in green technologies and practises.

Furthermore, sustainability is closely linked to global efforts to combat climate change. Green Credits contribute to greenhouse gas reduction goals set by international agreements such as the Paris Agreement. They provide a practical means for countries and organisations to meet their emission reduction targets while simultaneously promoting economic growth.

The concept of Green Credits has evolved over time. The roots of the Green Credits concept can be traced back to the early days of environmental awareness and conservation. In the late 20th century, as concerns about climate change and environmental degradation grew, there was a need for innovative solutions to address these issues.

The first iterations of Green Credits focused primarily on carbon reduction. They were developed as a response to the growing recognition of the role of carbon dioxide emissions in climate change. These early carbon credits aimed to incentivise businesses and individuals to reduce their carbon footprint by offering financial rewards for emissions reductions.

Over the years, the concept of Green Credits expanded to encompass a broader range of environmental benefits. Today, Green Credits can represent actions such as the preservation of biodiversity, the restoration of ecosystems, and the promotion of clean energy sources. This evolution reflects a growing understanding of the interconnectedness of environmental issues and the need for comprehensive solutions.

The Green Credits programme offers a range of compelling benefits. It provides individuals and organisations with the potential for financial incentives, helping offset the costs of eco-friendly projects and creating additional income streams. Furthermore, participants can take pride in their contributions to environmental conservation, including carbon reduction, habitat preservation, and water quality improvement.

For businesses, engagement in the programme showcases corporate responsibility and a commitment to sustainability, enhancing reputation and attracting eco-conscious customers. Additionally, Green Credits supports compliance with environmental regulations and emission reduction targets while also granting access to a growing sustainability-focused market. The programme's emphasis on eco-friendly solutions fosters innovation and research in sustainable practises and technologies.

Moreover, it appeals to consumers who prioritise sustainability, potentially boosting sales. Most importantly, participation in Green Credits reflects a global collaboration effort to combat climate change, uniting individuals and organisations in a shared commitment to a more sustainable future.

The Green Credits programme, like any initiative, faces its share of challenges and criticisms. Common concerns revolve around carbon offset integrity, where sceptics question whether offset purchases might lead to a false sense of emissions reduction; additionality, with doubts raised about whether credited actions would have occurred anyway; verification challenges, varying in rigour and reliability; market manipulation risks affecting credit prices; equity and access disparities favouring larger corporations; programme complexity hindering engagement; and questions about the long-term sustainability of environmental benefits. Recognising these concerns is crucial, as it paves the way for continuous improvement and transparency within the Green Credits programme, addressing these challenges to maximise its effectiveness.

The Indian government has been actively promoting the Green Credits Programmeme through various policy measures. This support includes tax incentives, subsidies, and regulatory frameworks that encourage participation. On June 27, 2023, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) released a notification for the draft Green Credit Programmeme Implementation Rules 2023. The notification outlines plans for a nationwide Green Credit Programmeme aimed at harnessing a competitive, market-oriented strategy for Green Credits. This initiative is designed to encourage voluntary environmental efforts from a range of stakeholders.

The world of Green Credits is evolving with technological advances like blockchain and IoT enhancing transparency. Green bonds will align more with Green Credits, offering funding for eco-projects. Recognition of natural capital's value will broaden Green Credits' scope. Circular economy credits, tied to recycling and waste reduction, may rise. Decentralised finance and blockchain enable easier participation, and expanding Green Credits in developing nations can transform sustainability and poverty alleviation.

India made a visionary commitment to attain zero carbon emissions by 2070 during the November 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) summit, to reduce emissions by one million tonnes over the next decade. Going forward, Green Credits emerge as the catalyst poised to usher in the era of zero carbon emissions, driving forward global environmental conservation and sustainability. Their ongoing expansion and transformation hold the key to crafting a future where our planet thrives, becoming greener, more inclusive, and more sustainable than ever before.",2023-10-03T07:56:18Z
Hindustan Times,"Calls for climate reparations, adaptation, and finance grow loud ahead of COP27",,"New Delhi: The annual United Nations (UN) climate change conference (Conference of the Parties-27 or COP27) is scheduled to begin in Egypt's Sharm El Sheikh in a month and a half. The two most significant, and intensely debated, issues likely to be on the COP27 agenda are climate finance for adaptation to climate impacts, and reparations for Loss and Damage caused by extreme weather events.

These issues are particularly important to India. ""In view of extreme weather events, increasing finance for adaptation and a decision on a new collective quantified climate finance goal will be critical for us and we think those will be the major issues at COP,"" a senior environment ministry official said.

""The Loss and Damage initiative will take centre stage in the upcoming COP. The countries which do not have any role in climate change are the worst affected ones,"" Bhupender Yadav, Union environment minister said on September 20, during a Clean and Green Globe conference organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry.

Loss and Damage refers to compensation for the impacts of extreme climate events and slow onset events such as sea-level rise or glacial retreat, while adaptation refers to adjustments in ecological, social, or economic systems in response to actual or expected climatic impacts, according to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It refers to changes in processes, practices, and structures to moderate potential damages.

Denmark on Tuesday pledged over $13 million (100 million Danish crowns) to support developing nations deal with losses caused by extreme weather events, becoming the first country to offer ""Loss and Damage"" compensation to vulnerable countries, Reuters reported. Antonio Guterres, UN secretary-general, also called on rich nations to pay up for climate devastation in poor countries during his speech at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday.

""Polluters must pay. Today, I am calling on all developed economies to tax the windfall profits of fossil fuel companies. Those funds should be re-directed in two ways: to countries suffering Loss and Damage caused by the climate crisis; and to people struggling with rising food and energy prices. As we head to the COP27 UN climate conference in Egypt, I appeal to all leaders to realise the goals of the Paris Agreement. Lift your climate ambition. Listen to your people's calls for change. Invest in solutions that lead to sustainable economic growth,"" he said.

Another reason there will be a strong demand for adaptation finance is because COP27 is being held in Africa, which has been suffering from an acute food and humanitarian crisis due to the climate crisis. The Greater Horn of Africa has already suffered the longest drought in 40 years, and parts of the region are bracing for a fifth consecutive failed rainy season, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said last month.

""The important thing that is going to emerge at COP27 is not the further enhancement of NDCs [Nationally Determined Contributions]. A large number of countries, including India, have already updated their NDCs. The issue that may take centre stage at COP27 is not mitigation but adaptation. Mitigation has played its role in the global discourse, but with global supply chains currently under disruption and extreme events with disastrous impact all around us, the appetite for further intense discussion on mitigation will be much less. The performance of various countries on their 2030 NDCs will be assessed in any case in a year or two through the global stock-take,"" said RR Rashmi, distinguished fellow and programme director, Earth Science and Climate Change, The Energy and Resources Institute, during a webinar on Pathways for India's long-term strategy to achieve Net Zero by 2070 on Wednesday.

""The best bet for furthering the ambition is to have more progress on long-term and implementable strategies for growth in as many countries as possible. The focus of COP27 logically therefore should and will be on adaptation. COP is being held in Africa where adaptation is a very important issue. But what kind of outcomes are expected to be seen is hard to judge,"" Rashmi added.

""Unfortunately, Loss and Damage is not even on the formal agenda. On adaptation, there will be discussion on global adaptation goal. There is no agreement on a long-term adaptation finance goal either. At best, what this COP can achieve is to formulate a clear strategy on indicators for global adaptation goals. It is not simply about finance, it is also about adaptation strategy. For example, early warning systems in each country to predict the extreme weather events. In India, you can see the ability to address extreme disasters has gone up because of early warning systems. Similarly, the systems and resources to create resilient infrastructure and address land degradation, or water scarcity. These should be part of the global adaptation goal in addition to higher finance,"" he added.

""The really interesting thing about COP 27 is whether or not, given the fact that the COP is being held in Africa and that we have had these extreme weather events this year which include really serious disruptions in South Asia, in Europe, in US, we get a head of steam on the political agenda for some sort of serious consideration on adaption financing as well as loss and damage. The UN secretary general called for some kind of distributive tax on the fossil fuel industry. More than a decade ago there used to be a lot of discussion on a currency transaction tax which is a good way of generating money for the global system. Those kinds of conversations may be back and about direct payments for compensation. If there was a serious opportunity to discuss finance to ameliorate impacts of climate change then this is that moment,"" said Navroz Dubash, professor at the Centre for Policy Research, who focuses on climate change policy and governance who addressed the same webinar.

The issue of reparations has been contested by developed countries during past COPs. India intervened strongly three times to emphasise Loss and Damage and the finances needed to mitigate the impacts of global warming at the Bonn climate conference in June. ""Averting, minimising and addressing Loss and Damage is mandated in the Article 8 of the Paris Agreement,"" an environment ministry official had said from Bonn.

Several country groupings including G77 and China, the Alliance of Small Island States, Small Island Developing States and Least Developed Countries pressed for a separate agenda on establishing a separate Loss and Damage finance facility at COP26. The view on having a separate financing facility was opposed by the US, Australia, and the European Union, which instead pushed the importance of insurance, catastrophe bonds and bilateral assistance during the dialogue, officials had said.

Through climate models and observational data, climate scientists have already established how the climate crisis has made extreme weather events this year several times more likely.

These include the the spring heatwave in India and Pakistan during March to May and the monsoonal floods in Pakistan and parts of India. The March-April spring heatwave spell in India and Pakistan was about 30 times more likely to happen because of human-caused climate crisis, the World Weather Attribution (WWA) network, an international team of leading climate scientists, said in May.

The results of their rapid analysis showed that the unusually long and early onset heatwave spell in India and Pakistan is very rare, with a chance of occurring only once in 100 years. Pakistan floods that devastated large parts of the country in August, leaving hundreds of thousands of people homeless and killing around 1,500 people was made highly likely due to climate crisis, WWA concluded in a statement on September 15.

The 5-day maximum rainfall over the provinces Sindh and Balochistan is now about 75% more intense than it would have been had the climate not warmed by 1.2 degree Celsius, whereas the 60-day rain across the basin is now about 50% more intense, meaning rainfall this heavy is now more likely to happen. There are large uncertainties in these estimates due to the high variability in rainfall in the region, and observed changes can have a variety of drivers, including, but not limited to, climate change,"" a statement by WWA said.

""There are two arguments for Loss and Damage: The Pakistan floods are on top of everyone's minds ahead of COP27. One that private sector commercial insurance completely breaks down in the case of climate disasters of this magnitude. In the past people have talked about insurance mechanisms with a layer of public finance but in front of such disasters it completely breaks down. Then, where will the additional money for loss and damage come from?

The COP26 discussions happened before the Ukraine war broke out. If, at that time, developed countries said don't expect $100 billion per year until 2023, now additional Loss and Damage finance seems beyond what people are willing to discuss. However, there are ideas about innovative new sources of finance such as windfall tax on fossil fuel companies; a fee on voluntary carbon market transactions for buyers; a tax on business class travel; debt for climate swaps. So, there are additional sources of raising finance.

More than the finance, it is the sceptre of being held legally liable that stops developed countries from talking about loss and damage at the negotiations,"" explained Ulka Kelkar, director, climate programme at World Resources Institute, during the briefing on Wednesday.",2022-09-22T15:53:00Z
The Times of India,More needs to be done to reach Paris goal: UN report - Times of India,Vishwa Mohan,"NEW DELHI: Countries, including India, may have divergent views on the details of how to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change but they have expressed broad agreement that ""more action by all nations and support for developing countries is needed to limit global warming to 1.5 degree Celsius"" as the pre-2020 climate action has been insufficient, noted a new synthesis report of the UN climate body.

Released late Wednesday night, the report also endorsed the G20 leaders' commitment under the New Delhi declaration to work for reducing global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 43% from 2019 levels by 2030, and facilitate commitment towards global peaking of emissions at the earliest and by 2025, and reach net zero CO2 emissions by 2050.

It noted that many countries emphasised that the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) -- climate ac tions -- should collectively reflect the ambition required to limit warming to 1.5 degree celsius by end of the century.

The earth's global average surface temperatures already reached around 1.1 degrees C higher than the preindustrial average (1850-1900) whereas a minimum 1.7 degree C increase in warming is predicted at the current level of NDCs.

""The report is again telling us that the world is offtrack. COP28 is the moment for all Parties (countries) to come together and put actionable solutions on the table. We must be ready with real answers to tackle the challenges, eradicate 22 gigatons of emissions by 2030, strengthen global resilience and mobilise finance at the scale necessary to enable a just and equitable transition. Now is the time to unite, act, and deliver a strong negotiated outcome on the global stocktake,"" said Sultan Al Jaber, COP28 president-designate.

The synthesis report is designed to help governments reach a decision on the global stocktake at 28th session of COP28 in Dubai in December.

As per a press statement by ICC, over the past seven years (2015-2021), a total of Rs 67,193.41 crores was allocated to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funding, but only a mere Rs 6,183.04 crore went towards environment-related issues.

""Climate funding, which focuses on greenhouse gas emissions and climate change impacts, lacks clear tracking. With climate change becoming a global priority for this decade, there is a critical need to increase funding in this sector. Regions like Northeast India, which are highly vulnerable to climate change, have received a scant 1.78% (Rs 110.6 crore) of the CSR funds allocated to environment-related issues,"" the statement said.

ICC's engagement with over 40 mid-sized corporations in India revealed a positive trend, as more than 80% of them expressed interest in funding climate projects, it said.

""However, the actual allocation towards the environment sector stands at a meager 9.2%. This significant disparity highlights the urgent need to bridge the gap between the willingness to fund climate action and the actual funding of projects with a climate focus in India,"" the statement said.

Through extensive interactions within the climate ecosystem, the India Climate Collaborative recognized that non-profit organizations across the country are pioneering community-focused and cost-effective climate solutions that address socio-economic priorities. To make a substantial impact, these solutions require increased visibility and funding support.",2023-07-24T17:10:00Z
Hindustan Times,"Indian diplomacy's climate test, writes Syed Akbaruddin - analysis - Hindustan Times",,"India has been an overachiever on Paris -- but the road ahead is strewn with challenges

Come 2021, the climate for diplomacy will change. In 2020, the black swan event of the pandemic was unforeseen. In contrast, the pivoting of the global diplomatic agenda towards the climate crisis is visible.

Numerous conventional diplomatic issues loom on India's horizon. They include tackling China's increasing assertiveness and engaging a new United States (US) administration; reinforcing bonds with our neighbours and strengthening bridges with our extended neighbourhood; bolstering relations with the European Union (EU) and reinvigorating ties with a post-Brexit United Kingdom; countering the perennial pestilence of midnight's other child; and enhancing our burgeoning ties with developing states globally. However, its the unconventional that may upend all these important goals.

When climate takes centre stage of global policymaking, the economic, social and political implications of the solutions to address the transboundary concerns are likely to override all else on the diplomatic agenda. The announcement of John Kerry's appointment to the new post of special presidential envoy for climate is an indication that US President-elect Joe Biden's climate agenda is global. Kerry's assertion that, ""America will soon have a government that treats the climate crisis as the urgent national security threat that it is"" reflects the thinking that the impact of the climate crisis is becoming more complex.

Calls for greater ambition to reach net carbon neutrality by 2050 have gathered steam. The Virtual Climate Ambition Summit held on the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement on December 12 is a precursor to the efforts underway. More than 125 states have committed to the goal of a net zero carbon future by 2050. Others are veering towards it. A majority of the G-20 are on board; 38 countries have declared ""climate emergencies"" until carbon neutrality is reached. China has provided a goal of 2060 and sees climate diplomacy as an opportunity at resuming the G-2 playbook of the Paris Agreement. The incoming Biden Administration is expected to set its target too. Once the US gets on board, those accounting for 63% of global greenhouse emissions would have agreed to carbon neutrality targets. Despite their announcements, there are gaps between 2050 targets and the policies that these countries have put in place.

India is one of the few overachievers in terms of meeting the Nationally Determined Contributions announced under the Paris Agreement for 2030. At the same time, India, as yet, is not in a position to set an economy-wide net-zero target as it needs to sustain economic growth, pull millions out of poverty and provide power to them. Our policymakers are struggling to find solutions to restrain stubble-burning in some regions despite their horrendous impact in nearby regions. The diverse sensitivities that need to be borne in mind in our global engagement will far surpass the concerns our trade negotiators went into Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) negotiations had to take into account. Climate negotiations potentially are more far-reaching for our polity, economy and society. Several are suggesting that our best option is a ""No"" to more ambitious commitments.

However, we need to be cognisant that some are preparing tools of coercive climate diplomacy. EU is eyeing a carbon border adjustment mechanism by 2021. The Biden administration will also look to favour a carbon tax with border adjustments, although whether it can get through such legislation remains uncertain. Kerry will try for a major international breakthrough in his first year. Having witnessed his hectoring approach to promote ratification of the Paris Agreement, caution needs to be our watchword. For a sui generis state such as ours with varied interests, to gather allies with similar climate goals is not easy.

The Conference of Parties (COP) 26 in Glasgow next year will not be just another multilateral meeting. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, addressing the Climate Ambition Summit, signaled that, ""Centennial India will not only meet its own targets, but will also exceed your expectations"". It is now for our thought leaders and officials to flesh this out and suggest options. These could perhaps be of a sectoral nature and encompass power, transport, agriculture and forests as possible areas for achieving decarbonising target dates.

India has set up an Apex Committee for Implementation of Paris Agreement (AIPA) to ensure coordination among 14 key ministries and to engage business and other stakeholders. We will also need to leverage bilateral ties with key players such as the US and EU; espouse common concerns in plurilateral groups such as BRICS which we currently chair; and make tactical alliances where possible. Besides, the thrust towards climate crisis as an international peace and security issue is likely to grow. Diplomacy will inevitably be a tool in addressing the growing importance of the phenomenon.

It may be time for the ministry of external affairs to foster greater integration and coherence in the evolving external dimensions of India's approach to the multi-faceted nature of climate crisis challenges in various forms.

The world cannot solve the climate crisis without India's active participation. While contributing to the global effort, we will need to seek an equitable outcome based on climate justice that also provides for financing and space for our transition. While the policies of the developed countries are the primary cause of this phenomenon, a sustainable global transition is in India's interests too.",2020-12-16T14:47:00Z
The Times of India,Cabinet decides to ratify Paris Agreement - Times of India,,"New Delhi, Sep 28 (IANS) The Union Cabinet on Wednesday decided to ratify the Paris Agreement on climate change.

The decision was taken at a Cabinet meeting here presided over by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

""Today the Cabinet decided to ratify the Paris Agreement,"" Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar later told reporters.

Modi had announced during the BJP National Council meeting on Sunday that India would ratify the 21st Conference of Parties (CoP) protocol on combating climate change on the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary on October 2.

Javadekar said 61 countries had ratified the protocol, but implementation of the agreement also required that at least 55 per cent of world emissions were captured among the countries ratifying it.

He said there was a shortfall of 3.5 per cent to cross the ""55 per cent pollution barrier"" and it would be crossed with India's decision to ratify the agreement.

""India became a decisive partner in the ratification process,"" he said.

Javadekar said the Paris agreement would get implemented post-2020 and India would seek action from the developed world in the pre-2020 period.

""India's decision to ratify the agreement will take the number of cumulative level of emission of countries that have ratified the agreement so far to 51.89 per cent,"" said an official statement.

""With the willingness expressed by several other countries to ratify the agreement before the end of this year, it is expected that the Agreement will enter into force soon and give a thrust to the global actions to address climate change,"" it added.

The statement further said: ""While agreeing to ratify the Paris Agreement, the Cabinet has also decided that India should declare that it will treat its national laws, its development agenda, availability of means of implementation, its assessment of global commitment to combating climate change, and predictable and affordable access to cleaner source of energy as the context, in which the Agreement is being ratified.""

The Paris Agreement was adopted by 185 nations on December 12 last year and India signed it in New York on April 22 this year. A total of 191 countries have signed the Paris Agreement so far.

As per the provisions of the Paris Agreement, the treaty will come into force as and when 55 countries contributing to 55 per cent of the total global emissions ratify the Agreement.

So far, 61 countries have deposited their instruments of ratification, acceptance or approval, accounting for 47.79 per cent of the total global greenhouse gas emissions.

The Times of India,Post-Pachauri TERI looks to get image boost by roping in PM Modi for its global summit - Times of India,Vishwa Mohan,"NEW DELHI: The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), that drew a lot of negative attention due to alleged involvement of its founder R K Pachauri in a sexual harassment case, is looking to give its image a boost by roping in Prime Minister Narendra Modi to inaugurate its World Sustainable Development Summit that is scheduled to be held here in October.

""We have invited the Prime Minister to inaugurate the sustainable development summit either on October 5 or 6, depending on his schedule"", said Ajay Mathur, the present director general of this Delhi-based energy and sustainable development think tank.

He said, ""We hope this marks an important point in the calender as we move ahead with the implementation of both the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement (on climate change)"".

The TERI's World Sustainable Development Summit (WSDS) will be among the first international summits to discuss the new agenda post the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the COP21 - signing of the landmark Paris Agreement.

Mathur, member of the Prime Minister's Council on Climate Change, had taken over as TERI director general in February, replacing Pachauri who was removed from his post in the wake of the allegations of sexual harassment.

In an interview to the TOI on Tuesday, Mathur sought to drive home the point that an institution has always been bigger than an individual (Pachauri) and the TERI under the new leadership has consistently been contributing in the fields of renewable energy, water conservation and sustainable development.

Mathur, who has been a key climate change negotiator on behalf of India, said the cost of renewable energy was the ""single biggest challenge"" as the country moves towards meeting its target of having 40% clean energy in its total energy mix by 2030 as pledged in the Paris Agreement.

""Today we are committed to increasing the amount of renewable (solar, wind and bio-mass). But if renewable costs more than coal and its share increases in the energy mix, the price of electricity that you and I pay will also keep on increasing. So, it is important that the price of renewable has to fall and fall fast"", said Mathur who was chief of the power ministry's Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) before taking over as the DG of the TERI.

How would India face this challenge and overcome the problem of pricing? ""One is to continue with the current process of large competitive procurements. Once people (investors\manufacturers) know that you are going to have large procurement and it will keep on increasing then there will be investment in the capacity....it'll bring economies of scale. Secondly, technology development needs to move from the lab to the field and into commercial use, particularly the storage (of renewable energy) technology. If these two things happen then I think we can address the issue (of cost). It can be done and I am very optimistic about it"", Mathur said.

Seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - adopted by world leaders in September 2015 at the historic UN Summit - officially came into force on January 1. Accordingly, countries including India will have to mobilize efforts to end all forms of poverty, fight inequalities and tackle climate change over the next 15 years.

Asked whether India is on the right track to implement the SDGs, Mathur said the key issue at present was to measure the existing problems - be it poverty, housing, energy demand etc.

He said, ""It is said what is measured is what is managed. The NITI Aayog and ministry of statistics and programme implementation have been in the process of measuring those issues (problems\demand\productivity) through the collection of data and its consolidation. The TERI has been contributing in this process"".",2016-07-12T18:11:00Z
The Times of India,Paris Agreement on climate change to be signed today in New York - Times of India,,"New Delhi, Apr. 22 (ANI): India will sign the Paris Agreement on climate change in New York today at a high-level ceremony convened by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as Minister of State for Environment, Forests and Climate Change Prakash Javadekar will sign the agreement.

The agreement was adopted by more than 190 countries in the French capital in December last year.

India had advocated a strong and durable climate agreement based on the principles and provisions of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Along with India, as many as 170 countries are expected to sign the agreement.

The ceremony today will set a record for international diplomacy as never before have so many countries inked an agreement on the first day of the signing period.

A United Nations body had, earlier, said that this record number of countries would surpass the previous record of 119 signatures for an opening day signing for an international agreement, set by the Law of the Sea in Montego Bay in 1994.

The signing ceremony will mark the first step towards ensuring that the Paris Agreement enters into force as early as possible.

The agreement will enter into force 30 days after at least 55 countries, accounting for 55 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. (ANI)",2016-04-22T04:01:00Z
Hindustan Times,COP26: HAC asks all parties to deliver on net zero emissions target,,"New Delhi: The High Ambition Coalition (HAC), which includes the US, Germany, France and several others, in a statement issued at the Glasgow climate change conference (COP 26) on Tuesday, called on all 196 parties to deliver on mid-century net zero greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) goals with strategies for their implementation that align with a 1.5 degree C trajectory as soon as possible, and in time for consideration by leaders at the global stocktake in 2023.

The HAC has also called on parties to commit to a collective goal of reducing global methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030, and to take aggressive action to reduce emissions of all super-pollutants, including hydrofluorocarbons and black carbon. HAC's intervention could pose a challenge to emerging economies like India and others who have been calling for equity and common-but-differentiated responsibilities (a principle within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that acknowledges different capabilities and differing responsibilities of individual countries) in mitigating climate crisis.

The Republic of the Marshall Islands formed the HAC in run-up negotiations to the Paris Agreement in 2015. The HAC helped secure key elements of the Paris deal, including the 1.5 degree C temperature goal, the net zero global emissions pathway by the second half of the century, and a five-year cycle for updating mitigation contributions, according to their website.

The HAC also stressed the need to halve global emissions by 2030 and called on all Parties to deliver more ambitious NDCs in line with a 1.5 degree C trajectory as soon as possible and well ahead of COP27. Several climate vulnerable island nations, such as Palau, Marshall Islands, Fiji, Antigua and Barbuda, are also part of the coalition. US President Joe Biden, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron have signed off the statement.

""This could be a problem going ahead. It has the US in it which is powerful. There is no mention of equity. It's aligned to an ambitious target of 1.5 degree C with no mention of common but differentiated responsibilities. It can pose a challenge, especially to emerging economies,"" said a senior climate negotiations expert on condition of anonymity.

HAC has also called on all developed countries to deliver on the goal of mobilising $100 billion annually till 2025 in the ""context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation."" Some developing countries may have reservations on this also as to which actions will be considered meaningful. The coalition suggested that the adaptation finance gap be addressed by scaling up adaptation finance to at least double the current levels.

""Reiterate our commitment to make finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development, and commit to initiating deliberations for a post-2025 finance goal based on the best available science, an assessment of the needs and priorities of developing countries, and lessons from the $100 billion goal,"" the HAC statement said.

""Why should we align to a common timeframe of achieving net zero emissions by mid-century? We have always said if that time frame needs to be aligned with, then historical emitters should transition at least by 2030. They can say all this in their statement but CBDR will have to be respected,"" said a member of the Indian delegation in Glasgow.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on November 1 that India will reach carbon neutrality by 2070. He also announced a five-point action plan that includes: India will increase its non-fossil fuel power capacity to 500 gigawatts (GW) by the end of the decade, up from 450GW; half of India's electricity (installed capacity) will come from renewable sources by 2030; India's 2030 carbon intensity goal -- measured as carbon dioxide emissions per unit of gross domestic product -- will be increased from 35% to 45%; and the country will also strive to produce half of its electricity using renewable energy and cut carbon-dioxide emissions by 1 billion tonnes from business as usual by 2030.

Another expert said, ""If you go by this statement, then there will be pressure over China also as they have announced net zero transition by 2060 and their NDC is weak. But China has already emitted a lot and is now the largest emitter in the world.""

According to a recent analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment, in the coming ten years, China will take up 33% of the remaining carbon budget of 409 GtCO2 and India may occupy only 9.54% of the budget. Between 1870 and 2019, China occupied 13.4% of the global carbon budget; India 3.16% and the seven historical polluters -- United Kingdom, United States, European Union-27, Russia, Japan, Australia, and Canada occupied 60.53% of the carbon budget. The share changed quite a bit between 1990 and 2019, when China occupied nearly 21% of the carbon budget. This means China went through a very intense phase of development mainly dependent on fossil fuels during those 20 odd years.

The issue of net zero emission is anyway inequitable. If it were to be equitable, developed (OECD) countries should have a target of net zero by 2030, China by 2040 and India and the rest of the world by 2050, the Centre for Science and Environment highlighted in a statement on Tuesday.

HT reported on Wednesday that several developing countries have backed India's demands at the COP26 climate summit for a new finance goal to support the energy transition.

Apurba Mitra, Head, Climate-policy, World Resources Institute India, said: ""The high ambition coalition is a subset of the parties to the UNFCCC and this will be one of the proposals discussed and negotiated over the next two weeks resulting in a final decision or declaration in Glasgow. Some of the elements of this proposal may find uptake, but may not be all. We will just have to wait and see how the element of differentiation and equity will be introduced in the final declaration, which is currently missing in this text.""",2021-11-03T18:15:00Z
The Hindu,Our time begins now,"Sujatha Byravan, Sudhir Chella Rajan","India stands to suffer most from climate change. A road map to transit quickly to a near-zero carbon economy

Even at the time of its signing in 2015, it was clear that the Paris Agreement on climate change would not be enough to avoid global warming of 1.5° C over pre-industrial temperatures. In fact, early analyses revealed that the collective effect of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) would result in 3-5° C of warming. More recently, there has been mounting pressure on India to raise its pledges further. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on 1.5° C has come at a time when there are multiple alarms for India. Another study in Nature Climate Change identifies India as the country with the most expected damage from rising levels of carbon dioxide. How should India respond?

India's NDC is already ambitious and it has made decisive changes in its energy sector. Meanwhile, the U.S. has pulled out of the climate treaty, and the support of Australia and Brazil teeters on the outcome of their respective elections. Some countries are also doing less than they claim. According to Kevin Anderson at the University of Manchester, with aviation, shipping and trade counted, the U.K. has made no reduction to its greenhouse gas emissions.

India has two complex and inter-related problems. The first is to bring a vast population out of poverty and into decent lives. The second is to do this while dealing responsibly with the global carbon challenge and building resilience to climate change.

While India is often mentioned along with China in climate-related discussions as a large emerging economy, the two are very different. India ranks 130 among nations in the Human Development Index, and China ranks 86. In spite of remarkable recent improvements, India still has 364 million living in multidimensional poverty. Nearly a third (27.5%) are multidimensionally poor and about a fifth (19.1%) are vulnerable to becoming poor. Almost half the country is therefore at high risk from events such as loss of a job or ill health of a family member. Combined with damage from a severe cyclone, flood or drought, each subsequent shock will have a multiplier effect on hundreds of millions, potentially pushing them deeper into poverty.

Add to this the current rural distress and the large youth bulge with few job prospects, and the country is in dire straits. It is clear that past development frameworks have not improved well-being across social strata. Instead, evidence indicates that economic growth has gone hand-in-hand with rising inequality and the creation of a small but powerful class of the super-rich.

It turns out that the most sensible way to deal with these complex challenges is to deepen and expand India's commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The synergies of meeting SDGs, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to a changing climate can only be fully realised if transformative and cross-scale changes are conceived, deliberated upon and tested widely. Further, ""scaling up"" may not be the correct way to think about what is needed; rather, replication with context-relevant modifications through local and institutional innovation may be more appropriate for a country of India's size and ecological diversity.

The 1.5° C report calls for societal transformation on a global scale that ""reflect[s] the links, synergies and trade-offs between mitigation, adaptation and sustainable development."" Recent events, however, show that we cannot trade off forests, urban water bodies, riverine ecosystems, waste management or groundwater as these come back to bite us as floods, landslides, droughts and infectious disease.

India, nevertheless, has a large number of successful examples of transformative innovation around energy production and access, land, livelihoods and climate resilience. The Bureau of Energy Efficiency showed how government 'nudges' are made effective through appliance labelling and large-scale procurement of efficient devices. In the building and cement industry, innovation around housing and new materials, including natural fibre composites, could make far-reaching changes in infrastructure through low-carbon modular technologies.

India expects to reach its ambitious solar target of 100 GW capacity by 2022 primarily through large centralised solar power plants, but these require significant amounts of land, water and evacuation infrastructure and support from mega-corporations. Instead, as some States have shown, renewable-based microgrids can become an important feature of electricity policy. Jharkhand, which has 249 remote villages powered by solar microgrids, is now considering their use even in villages that are already grid connected.

In the near future, entrepreneurs could make use of rapidly lowering storage costs to build decentralised, neighbourhood-scale micro-utilities, managed by locally owned enterprises and cooperatives. With modern power electronics and innovations in hybrid waste to energy, water recycling and community gardens could be integrated as standalone modules that are connected to larger grids.

Sustainable approaches to land are evident in cases such as forest conservation in Mendha-Lekha village in Maharashtra and community delivery of public services in Nagaland. These and several other instances are documented in initiatives such as Vikalp Sangam. Similarly, in a recent comment in Nature, Harini Nagendra points out that India has for long had strongly rooted cultural movements about living sustainably with land and its ecology that provide practical models.

Some research groups have recognised that agro-ecology methods are best suited for increasing crop yield, raising profits, trapping soil carbon, reducing dependence on fertilisers and pesticides. Successful models are already effective on small scales in many States. Andhra Pradesh is attempting to replicate widely one such approach, Zero Budget Natural Farming, to all its farmers by 2024 with an expected savings of 2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. This is with 6 million farmers across 8 million hectares. If similar methods were used for the entire country, the savings would be substantial.

In transport and urbanisation, the challenge is to create isotropic communities in the areas of the peri-urban, the rapidly expanding hinterland, which would have to be designed around not cars but walking, cycling and sustainable neighbourhood vehicles. Work and industry would also have to focus on the small and medium scale of about 300 employees and modest capital investments, which reduce the risk of speculation and jobless growth.

Energy and livelihood gains from such alternative visions could be far more significant than conventional ways of replacing fossil-fuelled infrastructure with renewables. But they also involve a lot of learning-by-doing, living laboratories and innovation, practice, patience and support from government and academia.

The next round of state action plans on climate change now being developed might begin with identifying successful development approaches overlaid with expected climate impacts in each ecological zone. Policymakers, with inputs from academia, community workers and the public, could then work on how these would be repeated in other contexts keeping climate impacts in mind.

Large investments are needed to make the transitions in each sector that would take the country to a near zero-carbon economy. But given the shortage of external support and the need for rapid deployment, India will not be able to rely entirely on external funds. Some of this could instead be financed through a 'luxury' carbon tax that curbs non-essential consumption. Savings can also be expected from the economic and social transformation itself.

Political pressure and activism across the globe may soon turn the tide in other countries, but India needs to begin now with its enormous untapped successes. We cannot be pressured from outside, but need to change from within.",2018-10-25T19:15:00Z
The Times of India,India could raise WTO ruling at UN while signing COP 21 deal - Times of India,,"New Delhi, April 19 (IANS) Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar, who will be leaving for New York to ratify the Paris 'COP 21 Global Climate Agreement', on Tuesday hinted that India could raise the issue of the WTO ruling against the Indian Domestic Solar Mission.New Delhi, April 19 (IANS) Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar, who will be leaving for New York to ratify the Paris 'COP 21 Global Climate Agreement', on Tuesday hinted that India could raise the issue of the WTO ruling against the Indian Domestic Solar Mission.

""We are giving space to our local manufacturers here and the ruling would affect them. We would take it up,"" Javadekar said here after releasing a document titled ""India's action on climate change after the Paris agreement"".

He, however, said officials from the ministry of commerce and industry will be the ones who would decide and take the final call on the WTO issue.

Javadekar said that India along with over 130 countries, would ratify the Paris agreement at a high level signing ceremony at the UN headquarters in New York on April 22. He will be leaving for the UN on Wednesday and will also attend the Major Economies Forum on April 23 and 24.

The minister on April 7, along with Brazil, South Africa, India and China, had welcomed the adoption of the Paris agreement on climate change -- the 21st Conference of Parties (COP-21) -- in December last year.

China, which is eyeing the Indian solar market, had extended its support to New Delhi against the WTO ruling.

The WTO on February 24 ruled against India's 'Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission' on the plea that New Delhi's efforts towards the indigenous production of solar cells violated WTO rules. The ruling came on a 2013 complaint filed by the US.

The US had said India violated domestic content requirements (DCR) rules. India appealed against the WTO ruling, claiming its compliance with laws required to promote sustainable development.

India also argued that its solar programme was helping it to meet its commitments under the UNFCCC.

India's solar energy programme is considered one of the world's largest and fastest renewable energy programmes. The country had also scaled up its target to produce solar energy by pushing ahead the 20,000 megawatts of solar electricity generation to 1 lakh megawatts by 2022.

Meanwhile, Javadekar also called upon the developed nations to declare their enhanced action plan for the second period of the Kyoto Protocol and mobilising $100 billion towards climate change.

""We have levied a clean environment cess of $6 per tonne on coal. If the developed world follows India in taxing its coal production, $100 billion can be raised,"" he said.

He also said the developed world must provide technological support to the developing nations in the fight against climate change.

In the UN climate change conference COP 21 in Paris, 195 countries adopted the first universal, legally binding global climate deal.

The Times of India,India to formally sign Paris climate change accord on Apr 22 - Times of India,,"Mumbai, Apr 2 () India will formally sign the Paris agreement, adopted by more than 190 countries at last year's climate change summit in the French capital, at the UN Headquarters in New York later this month.

Noting that the summit, held in Novemeber-December last year in the French capital, helped change India's image of being ""negative and naysayer"" after Prime Minister Narendra Modi introduced the concept of climate justice, Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar blamed the ""uncontrolled"" carbon emission by developed nations for the present state of the climate.

""India, along with 100 other nations would ratify the Conference of Parties (COP) 21 global climate agreement on April 22.

Under the accord, at least 55 countries, accounting for an estimated 55 per cent of the total global greenhouse gas emissions, will have to ratify or approve the agreement before it enters into force.

""All countries have decided to walk the green path as per their common but differentiated responsibilities. India was always perceived to be a naysayer and negative in its approach and took a corner seat in most of the international conferences.

""But in Paris, Prime Minister Narendra Modi introduced the concept of climate justice driving home the message of sustainable development,"" Javadekar said while describing the Paris agreement as a ""victory of multilateralism"" and one which helped ""correct"" image perception of India.

He said climate change was a ""reality"" with one degree rise in temperature caused by 150 years of ""uncontrolled"" carbon emission by the developed world.

While 30 per cent of cumulative contribution was that of the US, 50 per cent by Europe, Canada and other developed countries and 10 per cent by China, while India was responsible for only 3 per cent carbon emission, he said. ""Though India is not part of the problem, it wants to be part of the solution. Our commitment is reflected in every programme being pursued by the government,"" Javadekar said.

The Times of India,"Bhupender Yadav:  Developed nations must shun the tendency of profiteering from a disaster, says environment minister Bhupender Yadav | India News - Times of India",,"NEW DELHI: India on Sunday urged the global North (developed countries) to shun ""the tendency of profiteering from a disaster"", reminding them that the climate change crisis is starkly different from other global crises of trade and finance and therefore they must stay away from traditional responses.

Articulating India's point at the Raisina Dialogue here, environment minister Bhupender Yadav said greenwashing, abrogating historical responsibilities (of rich nations who emitted a lot in the past) and protectionism in the name of climate action need to be stopped.

Noting that the adverse impact of climate has become ""alarmingly perceptible"" in the last decade or so, Yadav said, ""I would like to remind, especially friends from the global North, that we must understand that this crisis is starkly different from other global crises of trade and finance and therefore traditional responses and the tendency of profiteering from a disaster need to be shunned.""

His remarks clearly referred to the demands of developing countries who have long been insisting for technological support (sharing of cutting-edge technology without getting into business/trade aspects of intellectual property rights for profit making) from the North to help them on mitigation and adaptation fronts to deal with the challenges of climate change.

Various technologies including battery storage, carbon capture and utilization, energy efficient operations and even cost-effective electrolysers for production of green hydrogen are available in the developed countries, but the business aspects of it deterred the developers to share it with developing countries even as the world is facing the urgency to adopt low emission measures and adapt itself to face the common climate crisis.

Emphasizing that he did not want to impose an opinion but to kindle an aspiration, Yadav saidhe was confident that through its G20 presidency, India will work with its partners to put forward a ""coherent roadmap for climate action and sustainable development"" which puts the concerns of the global South (developing countries) at the centre when it comes to making ""climate smart policies"", domestically and globally.

He said climate smart policies act as a policy tool for specific action for sustainable development. ""It is unfortunate that the world learnt about the concept of sustainability the hard way. We are now witness to how mindless consumption and unplanned development has jeopardized food and energy security across many nations. There are developing countries that are reeling under the menace of unsustainable debt and at the same time are also victims of unsustainable consumption and production processes of the developed world,"" said Yadav while delivering his speech that reflects the concerns of all developing and least developed countries.

Yadav said the theme for India's G20 Presidency: Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam - One Earth, One Family, One Future - reimagines the world as a family with shared interest and a common future. ""It underscores the need to join efforts to face challenges and create a better world order. Mission LiFE is a clarion call given by the Prime Minister (Narendra Modi) in the same spirit, underpinning the need to bring individual efforts at the forefront of global climate action,"" said the minister.",2023-03-05T17:13:00Z
The Times of India,Air pollution missing from India's climate plans: Study - Times of India,Manka Behl,"Nagpur: India scored 2 out of 15 points when it comes to integrating clean air in its national climate plan. A new scorecard by Global Climate and Health Alliance also highlighted the strong link between air pollution and mortality in the country, with 119.9 deaths reported per 100,000 population from toxic air.

The 'Clean Air NDC Scorecard', a brainchild of over 150 health professionals and civil societies, revealed that the world's largest economies - the G20 nations -- are falling short of ensuring clean air in their climate goals. The methodology used for calculating the score was a deep dive analysis of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) of 169 countries. NDCs are the national climate plans submitted by governments as part of their commitment to the Paris Agreement.

The countries were broadly scored on five categories, including health impacts of air pollution, source sectors, major pollutants, economical aspect of pollution, and bonus points for additional efforts. India scored 'zero' in quantifying health impacts of pollution, discussing the cost of the crisis, and failing to take other mitigation measures.

The scorecard comes ahead of the United Nations' 28th Conference of the Parties (COP 28) which will be hosted by UAE this year. For the first time, an entire day will be dedicated to health in the annual climate conference.

Though experts believe that the scorecard is a big eye-opener ahead of the meet, they pointed out that India's analysis did not factor in some domestic efforts while calculating the rating. ""It is a valuable tool for fostering global awareness and collaboration in tackling these challenges. The findings highlight a global picture where many nations, particularly lower and middle-income countries, have demonstrated a strong commitment to clean air, climate, and health in their NDCs. While India's current score may not reflect domestic initiatives like the National Clean Air Program (NCAP), it is a reminder of the urgent need to strengthen policies and actions to improve air quality,"" said Bhavreen Kandhari, founder of Warrior Moms.

She added, ""We cannot ignore to address the interconnected challenges of air pollution, climate change and public health, and the importance of translating these commitments into tangible actions.""

Stressing on the importance of connecting global climate change and local air pollution sources, analyst at Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) Sunil Dahiya said, ""The absence of linkage of air pollution and climate change as well as national and global commitments can lead to divergent pathways at different levels. India is a good example of that; while it seems to be doing great on NDC compliance pathway, it is simultaneously expanding the fossil fuel infrastructure and production, possibly paving the way for future stranded assets, and shrinking finances for efficient energy transition.""

Hindustan Times,Mumbai's Climate Adaptation Plan: City and living with wetness,,"Mumbai's climate has changed. The cyclones, cloud bursts and very heavy rain days of this past monsoon season have made clear that human-caused climate change is not just something to anticipate in the future, but is already part of our everyday environment. Amidst this emergency, the city has begun drafting Mumbai's Climate Adaptation Plan (MCAP). Much will depend on how the plan is able to fundamentally reimagine and reorganize the city's relationship with water.

On August 27, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) launched its Climate Adaptation Planning process in a widely publicised event. The administrative and political leadership present was unequivocal about the urgency of climate change planning for the city. Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal spoke of multiple severe flooding events this past year. Maharashtra's environment minister Aaditya Thackeray insisted that the planning exercise cannot remain an environmental wishlist on paper. ""We don't have time,"" he said.

The BMC, working with not-for-profit environmental groups, World Resources Institute (WRI) India and Waatavaran solicited inputs from experts on key aspects of urban development: waste, energy and buildings, urban flooding and water, air pollution and urban greening. With these inputs, and in consultation with the C40 network of sustainable cities, the city has charged WRI to help it draft a climate action plan. The draft of the plan should be ready in a month, for another round of public feedback.

The plan's success will depend not only on its expansive vision but also on how well it would serve as an instrument of coordination across different urban bureaucracies and sectors. The process will also need to be broad-based and consultative to ensure the plan will address vulnerabilities of the marginalized. And if it seeks to reduce flooding, it requires nothing less than a complete reimagination of the relation between land and water in the city.

Not an island but an estuary

In their pioneering work from 2009, Soak: Rethinking Mumbai in an Estuary, Anuradha Mathur and Dilip Da Cunha have identified the city's hostile relationship to its different waters as a prime reason for much of the flooding in the city. They call for the city to move from urban planning projects that exacerbate the city's adversarial relationship with its rains and sea, towards practices that recognise and accommodate water. The city, they remind us, is not built on seven islands. The city is placed in an estuary.

For the last 300 years, the city has been made solid and dry through relentless projects of land filling. The floods that have regularly visited the city from its earliest days are a direct consequence of this land-making. Rain and tidal waters simply return every year to occupy the same grounds that were once khadi (wetlands), creek, or talab (pond).

As a result, the city's residents have long been accustomed to living with regular floods. With the intensification of the rains, the increase of cyclones and the rise in sea levels however, flooding is now more severe, more frequent and more widespread. It now occurs in parts of the city that never used to flood. The city's near future depends on how it plans for and adapts to the persistent and increasing presence of water in the city.

Inhabited Sea is a transdisciplinary, collaborative research project that I was involved with, sought to produce new imaginations of how we may live in cities with water. Started in 2019, the project brought together natural and social science researchers, architects, designers and artists in the United States and in India, to study what it might mean to design Mumbai amidst two gradients of wetness, the sea and the monsoon.

From this research, we find that if Mumbai's Climate Action Plan proceeds as planning traditionally has in the city, the floods will only get worse. This is because of important blind spots in traditional urban planning processes.

Cities Partitioned and Dried

First, urban plans are siloed and solid. They are narrow, top-down initiatives that divide up urban life into discrete parts of urban space, each addressed in different sections of the plan and in city bureaucracies.

In Mumbai, for instance, storm water drains, sewage and roads are all managed by different departments in the city. Yet, Rhea Shah in her Inhabited Sea project, Drawing on Wetness, found, waters are always mixing: nalas hold sewage, rivers hold storm waters, the sea enters rivers and wetlands, and leaking pipes recharge aquifers.

While conventional planning and even Mumbai's climate planning process treats these as distinct, they need to recognise that different waters (drinking, rain, sewage and sea) are part of a single interconnected urban waterscape. Accordingly, planning processes like the MCAP need to integrate landscape architecture perspectives that consider the relations of different waters, air and land use systemically, and not as different sectors.

Second, urban planning assumes that the city can be dried. Yet Mumbai is always wet -- with the tides, wetlands, humidity, creeks, wells and rain. Rather than dealing with the impossibility of dewatering the city, planners need to see and support existing infrastructures that effectively hold water for some part of every day, month or year. Fortunately, the city still has a wealth of natural infrastructures -- creeks, wetlands, nalas, and talabs -- which provide considerable service to the city. Even at the MCAP climate consultations, the WRI quantified the significant economic benefit of mangroves that reduce the risks and costs of flooding, hold excess water during rain events, and also pull carbon out of the atmosphere. They are a mitigation as well as an adaptation infrastructure for the city.

Yet, because the value of natural infrastructures is neither recognised nor calculated in urban planning or development processes, their loss is assumed to not cost the city. Thus, large infrastructure projects, like the coastal road or metros are proposed and constructed without studying how much the loss of trees or permeable ground will cost the city in future flooding. As Thackeray said at the launch, there has to be a climate lens for every infrastructural development. A road that floods the city cannot be called development.

Valuing natural infrastructure

Natural infrastructures need to be more accurately valued when making development decisions. To some extent, this is happening with mangroves. But the rate fixed by the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 2009 is a gross underestimate of the ecosystem services provided by mangroves. The value assigned, at approximately ₹10 lakh per hectare, does not even cover the cost of land in Mumbai! The compensation for natural infrastructure loss, like mangrove habitat loss, needs to incorporate both the costs of land and the environmental services provided. Similarly rates, possibly payable to the city environment department, should be fixed for other natural infrastructures such as wetlands, intertidal regions and creeks and river floodplains, whose benefits -- carbon sequestration, recreational spaces, flood adaptation and infrastructure -- make the city a suitable place to live.

Natural infrastructures are generally more cost effective (they are free) and can better complement costly engineering solutions such as storm water drains and water retention tanks. Natural infrastructures are also more spatially efficient. They are often valuable commons that are used by many of the city's more marginalized populations for work.

As such, the Mumbai adaptation plan needs to recognise and support multiply-used urban commons that serve as recreation areas, permeable water holding infrastructures and carbon mitigation spaces at different times of year. This is especially critical for a congested city like Mumbai.

Maintaining water infrastructure

Since the 1920s, when the city constructed the massive Tansa dam, it has been found that adding new supply does not solve Mumbai's water problems. Instead, new source development constructs new problems. New dams caused deforestation and the displacement of adivasis in Thane district, Bharat Kaushal Punjabi pointed out in his 2015 thesis on the politics of water contestation in Mumbai-Thane region. New desalination plants consume lots of energy, raise sea temperatures and pollute water, causing harm to marine biodiversity. Neither deforestation and displacement, nor pollution and energy use are in line with Mumbai's mitigation and adaptation goals.

The city also has underground water sources it is not adequately using. For a long time, we have heard that Mumbai's ground water is contaminated and cannot be used. Yet, many residents of the city are already using well water, obtained through its private water tanker network. Can these resources be made available for the public? Following a year of low rainfall in 2009, the BMC found, renovated, and used water from 12,531 wells in the city in one month alone. With adequate maintenance, Mumbai's wells can continue to hydrate the city. Necessary policy changes can make everyday water insecurity and vulnerability, particularly for Mumbai's informal residents, a thing of the past.

The MCAP assessment on flooding and water resources points to the need to augment water sources in the city through desalination plants. This activity is fraught for all sorts of reasons, not least because new sources are totally unnecessary. As I show in my book, Hydraulic City: Water and the Infrastructures of Politics in Mumbai (2017), there is no water scarcity in city. All of the data points to the fact that the city receives enough water from its sources. The problem has to do with the significant inefficiencies of water distribution and leakages. According to one BMC report in 2009, these account for approximately 30% of water ""lost"" in the city.

A new paradigm

Following the catastrophic floods of July 26, 2005 the Chitale Committee Report pointed out that the rain event was an exceedingly rare, one-in-a-hundred-year event and that expanding the city's existing storm water infrastructure was necessary. Together with other interventions in the city, these would ensure that the network would work during normal times. But normal times are a thing of the past now. The extremely heavy rainfall of July 2005 has happened several times since, including this year. Rainfall intensity no longer meets our historical expectations. The city of Houston, for example experienced three one-in-500 year flood events in the span of just two years!

As such fforts to manage the city's rains in the present and future, based on 100-year-old technologies will always come up short, and more so because we are living in climate changed times. Storm water engineers working at MCGM confess that the storm water improvements made in the last 10 years are already insufficient for the new normal. City officials cannot expect to drain the seas, intense rains and storms of the present and near future through conventional technologies. With new water and landscape approaches, however, they can find ways for all the city's residents to live better with water.

The Times of India,World heading for 3.2 degree Celsius temperature rise by 2100: UN | India News - Times of India,,"NEW DELHI: Global emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) hit a new high in 2018 despite ""scientific warnings and political commitments"", said a UN report as it warned that the world is heading for an average temperature rise by 3.2 degree Celsius by 2100 bringing more disastrous consequences of climate change even if all current commitments under the Paris Agreement are implemented.

Released on Tuesday, ahead of the upcoming UN climate conference (COP25), the annual report of the UN Environment Programme - called Emission Gap Report - found that the GHG emissions have risen 1.5% per year over the last decade, hitting an all-time high of 55.3 giga tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions.

Pitching for substantial increase in collective ambition of all countries to reverse this rising trend, the report warned that unless global GHG emissions fall by 7.6% each year between 2020 and 2030, the world will miss the opportunity to get on track towards the goal of 1.5 degree Celsius temperature rise.

Though the report appealed to nations to increase their collective ambition of emission cuts by at least five-fold over the current levels for the 1.5 degree Celsius goal and three-fold for the 2 degree Celsius pathway, it clearly said developed nations would have to reduce their emissions ""quicker than developing countries"" in the short-term for ""reasons of fairness and equity"".

The report also noted that developed countries cannot just reduce emissions by exporting carbon pollution (GHG emitting activities such as manufacturing) to the emerging economies such as China, India, Brazil and South Africa.

""Our collective failure to act early and hard on climate change means we now must deliver deep cuts to emissions - over 7% each year, if we break it down evenly over the next decade,"" said Inger Andersen, UNEP's executive director.

""If we don't do this, the 1.5°C goal will be out of reach before 2030,"" she said in a statement. Her remarks ahead of COP25 assume significance as the world has already recorded 1.1 degree Celsius of global average temperature rise above pre-industrial (1850-1900) levels and there is little widow available to increase GHG emissions further.

It is expected that the countries during December 2-13 COP25 in Madrid would try to find a common ground to raise their climate action targets by 2020 to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. Over 195 countries had together in 2015 agreed to take climate actions to keep the global average temperature rise within 2 degree Celsius by 2100 and make efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Three years later, the UN's IPCC, however, pitched for 1.5 degree Celsius target, saying half a degree of warming makes things much worse in terms of having more frequent and intense extreme weather events and faster sea level rise by 2100.

Keeping such consequences in view, UNEP's Emission Gap Report each year assesses the gap between anticipated emissions in 2030 and levels consistent with the 1.5 degree Celsius and 2 degree Celsius goals of the Paris Agreement.

Since G-20 countries together account for around 78% of global GHG emissions, this year's report paid close attention to these big economies.

Noting these countries' current climate action targets - called nationally determined contributions (NDCs) - under the Paris Agreement, the report said seven countries such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Korea, South Africa and the USA required further action of varying degrees to achieve their NDCs while six other members - China, India, Mexico, Russia, Turkey and EU28 - were projected to meet their unconditional NDC targets with current policies.

As far as remaining three - Argentina, Indonesia and Saudi Arabia - are concerned, the studies put a question mark over their commitments to meet their respective climate action targets.",2019-11-27T01:42:00Z
The Times of India,IIT-Madras launches a school for sustainable future - Times of India,A Ragu Raman,"CHENNAI: IIT-Madras on Saturday launched the School of Sustainability to prepare students and working professionals on how to tackle big challenges like climate change and global warming and to moot sustainable solutions for the future.

This school will bring together faculty members from across departments and research centres of the institute.

Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance chairman Jayant Sinha inaugurated the school.

Terming the launch of the school as an important move, Sinha said, ""Dealing with sustainability and decarbonisation is the biggest scientific and engineering challenge of our times.""

""I want scientists and engineers to really focus on what we need to do to get us to sustainability. Because, right now, the path we are taking is not sustainable,"" he said.

""We have had the warmest September on record and much warmer than people had anticipated. We are in 2023 experiencing the warmest year that humanity has ever experienced. We have seen that in the extreme weather events across the world this year, from the fires in Canada to the flash floods in Sikkim. What we thought was going to happen once in 100 years is now happening every two or three years,"" Sinha said.

The school is planning to offer a minor course on sustainability and an interdisciplinary master's programme. It also plans to provide capacity building programmes to working professionals.

The school has identified four key areas of research and development including decarbonization, human settlements, modelling and scenario development, and behavioural and industrial change.

Kala Vairavamoorthy, executive director of the International Water Association, said, ""This school should encourage people to be more creative and create the sustainable future they are imagining.""

IIT-Madras director V Kamakoti highlighted various steps taken by the administration to make the campus sustainable in terms of water and energy. ""Freshwater consumption on the IIT-Madras campus has come down from 3.4 million litre a day to 1.4 million litre a day due to water recycling.""

""We will nurture this school and see that more innovations come in the area of sustainability,"" he said.

The Times of India,First climate change learning lab in Patna | Patna News - Times of India,,"PATNA: The Climate Change Learning Lab (CCLL) was inaugurated by environment, forest and climate change department minister Neeraj Kumar Singh 'Bablu' at Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park on Sunday. The lab is funded by the European Union and co-founded by the German Federal Ministry and implemented by GIZ to provide all the climate change related information to the relevant stakeholders, including students, youth, government officials and NGOs in an interactive manner in collaboration with the 'Strategic partnership for the implementation of the Paris Agreement' project.

""It is a great honour to have the first climate change lab of India in Bihar. I think climate change is not only an issue for India or Bihar, rather it is an universal issue for the entire world. India is working very hard to combat the issues related to climate change. The 'Jal-Jeevan-Hariyali' mission of the Bihar Government is a very important initiative in this field. Though Bihar is poor, it is one of the most attentive states, which makes it unique and different,"" the minister said.

Jai Kumar Gaurav, senior advisor, Climate Change GIZ, said the lab has been started as a GIZ initiative not only for information but to take action as well. ""This is just the beginning. We are looking forward to carry on many such projects across the country, including Bihar,"" he said.

""This lab will prove to be a great initiative because the contents are specific to Bihar,"" said Dr Arvind Kumar Chaudhary, principal secretary of the state environment, forest and climate change department.

""Bihar is one of the most impacted states due to climate change. To prevent this, the gap between the government and common masses should be filled to protect the mother earth.

Hindustan Times,Three ministries to form consortium for climate-related policies,,"Mumbai In a first, three ministries - earth sciences (MoES), science and technology, and environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC), are set to form a consortium for climate science, mitigation and adaptation.

On Monday, M Ravichandran, secretary, MoES, said that the idea of the inter-ministerial consortium is to avoid duplication of climate-related policy formulation and research, and work cohesively towards climate action and towards realising India's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) under the Paris Agreement.

NDC is a climate action plan including targets that are put forth by individual countries to cut emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change.

Ravichandran, who was the chief guest for the 10th anniversary of the Interdisciplinary Programme in climate studies at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Bombay, said that the consortium is likely to be in place in the next six months.

""The problem at present is that each ministry is working separately on climate-related issues, be it science, adaptation or mitigation. The prime minister has been consistently of the opinion that these ministries should not work in isolation, so as to ensure that societal issues are being addressed and solutions reach the common man,"" said Ravichandran.

He further added, ""MoES, DST and MoEFCC will work together along with academia, institutes and national laboratories to have different outcomes. We will discuss the modalities at our next monthly meeting.""

""One of the areas where the three ministries will converge is climate modelling with the aim to create an India-centric climate model,"" said Akhilesh Gupta, senior advisor, department of science and technology.

""Similarly, we can all work together on aerosols and establish an aerosol mission. Urban climate is another important focus area. India will also increasingly be impacted by extreme events and there is therefore a need for more robust work on an early warning system,"" added Gupta.

Stating that Prime Minister Narendra Modi wants these departments to work for a similar cause, Gupta said, ""The centre is spending a lot of money on climate research, but a significant amount of work is happening individually and leading to duplication. There is enough to be done in each department. Since the government is the first respondent to climate action and challenges, there is a need to work together within the government.""

The consortium will utilise the strength and expertise of each ministry towards achieving a common goal. For instance, while aerosol research can be undertaken by institutes under DST, MoES' forte lies in aerosol observation and policy formulation can be handled by MoEFCC. Similarly, in the field of glaciology, the National Mission for Sustaining the Himalayan Ecosystem is under DST, MoES undertakes scientific studies in Antarctica and Arctic and MoEFCC can focus on policy.

Gupta said departments working on climate change such as Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Indian Space Research Organisation, Department of Biotechnology and Department of Atomic Energy will also be roped into the consortium at a later stage.

The Interdisciplinary Programme in Climate Studies (IDPCS) at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Bombay and the India Meteorological Department signed a Memorandum of Understanding to develop climate solutions for stakeholders at village, city and district level. Some of the expected outcomes of the collaboration include sensors and drone based smart monitoring system, climate-smart agriculture technology for water and food security, climate and health, intelligent and automated early warning systems, among others. The MoU is a step towards IIT-Bombay's goal to establish a Centre of Excellence in Climate Services and Solutions within IDPCS.",2022-05-02T15:12:00Z

She was speaking on the possibilities of investment for cleaning Ganga and promoting wind energy.

""Absolutely, help will be required. We have lots of public financing options though,"" Faergemann told IANS on the sidelines of ""The World Sustainable Development Summit"" (WSDS), organised here by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI).

Appreciating India for ratifying Paris Climate Agreement, she said that the EU is all set to submit its instrument of ratification for Paris Climate agreement at New York on Friday, October 7.

She also spoke of exploring opportunities for Wind Energy in Tamil Nadu and Gujarat.

""India, one of the largest emerging economies with a population of over one billion and with challenges of sustainable food supply, adequate infrastructure, management of water and other natural resources and energy security. Unfortunately, these will be exacerbated withe the imapct of climate change,"" she said, adding that India is key actor for the successful implementation of the Paris Agreement on account of its influence on developing countries.

She expressed interest in expanding the EU-India cooperation to other climate-related issues.

""We are good at exporting our technologies. Every year, we export 35 billion euros worth of renewable equipment... As per estimates, it will mean $13.5 trillion of investment in renewables and energy efficiency over the next 15 years,"" she said at WSDS.

New Delhi, Sep 28 () The government today approved the proposal for ratification of the ""historic"" Paris climate deal which will be formalised on October 2, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, making India one of the key countries which would help bring the pact into force.

The nod by the Union Cabinet comes days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the decision which is expected to give momentum to implementation of measures at the international level to control global warming.

However, the government has decided to ratify the agreement ""in the context"" of its national laws, availability of means of implementation and ""its own assessment"" of global commitment to combating climate change.

""While agreeing to ratify the Paris Agreement, the Cabinet has also decided that India should declare that India will treat its national laws, its development agenda, availability of means of implementation, its assessment of global commitment to combating climate change, and predictable and affordable access to cleaner source of energy as the context in which the Agreement is being ratified,"" an official statement said.

Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said, with this, India will be one of the key countries which will be instrumental in bringing the Paris Agreement into force.

""Today the Union Cabinet approved the ratification of Paris Agreement which is a historic decision. With the ratification, India will be one of the key countries instrumental in bringing the Paris Agreement into force,"" Javadekar told reporters here.

The decision will further underline India's responsive leadership, which is committed to global cause of environment protection and climate justice, he said.

Javadekar said the pact will come into force after it has been ratified by at least 55 countries which account for 55 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.

So far, 61 countries have deposited their instruments of ratification, acceptance or approval accounting in total for 47.79 per cent of the total global greenhouse gas emissions.

India's decision to ratify the Agreement will take the number of cumulative level of emission of countries that have ratified the Agreement so far to 51.89 per cent as its total emissions is 4.1 per cent of the global emissions.

""Because of India's push, now the world will ratify the deal soon. It will become irreversible course of action for humankind. It is a common resolve to keep temperature rise below two degrees Celsius. Now that target is achievable,"" Javadekar said.

The Minister had earlier told reporters that the cumulative emissions of 61 countries put together was 51.89 per cent and India's ratification will help bridge the remaining 3 per cent to fulfil the second condition.

Jatin Shah, city engineer, who represented SMC in the workshop held last week said, ""Some innovative means were suggested during the workshop based on our report on mitigating climate change. We will be happy to implement the suggestions to improve our green cover.""

Lack of green cover results in rise in temperature in urban areas, creating health problems like skin diseases, reduces natural resources and even increase greenhouse emissions.

According to the last tree counting, Surat's green cover has depleted to about 3 lakh trees against the population of 50 lakh people which is not even 5%. Ideal figure is 15% green cover for urban spaces.

Some incentive schemes for planting trees and penalty for not planting trees to individual house - plot owners, setting up of centre of excellence to provide all information related to green life in city and even reserving minimum space for setting up parks and gardens in Town Planning (TP) schemes were suggested during the workshop.

""We were asked to formulate a road side plantation policy for rapid increase in green cover.Tree census should also be a regular feature to get the exact figure,"" said Shah

SMC commissioner, Milind Torwane said, ""We will be getting some technical assistance from international agencies. This will help us formulate strategies and execute them with the help of financial aid or some short term loans from international bodies.""",2016-06-01T01:35:00Z
The Times of India,India among 4 big economies set to meet Paris climate goals | India News - Times of India,Vishwa Mohan,"A new report by the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) reveals that India, Indonesia, the UK, and Switzerland are the only major economies on track to meet their Paris Agreement goals by 2030.

New Delhi: Unveiling a stark disparity in climate action ahead of the upcoming UN climate conference (CO), a new report of the Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF) - an international coalition of 58 countries highly vulnerable to a warming planet - said that India, Indonesia, the UK and Switzerland alone are amongst major economies currently on track to meet Paris Agreement goals based on their pledged targets for 2030.

The study, released on Monday, found that major economies largely set emissions targets that assume all nations reduce emissions at the same rate, failing to account for their greater share of pollution or to distinguish efforts between the richest and poorest countries based on their respective historical emissions.",2023-10-16T06:45:39Z
The Times of India,'life In Lucknow With Aqi 140 Is Like Smoking 7-8 Cigarettes A Day' | Lucknow News - Times of India,"TNN, Sep","Lucknow: Living in a city that records an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 140 and more is like smoking 7-8 cigarettes a day. Lucknow, at least during the peak winter period, is one of the nine such cities in Uttar Pradesh.

These were a few of the disturbing facts that came to the fore during a daylong workshop on air pollution and climate change organised by the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) and the Lung Care Foundation (LCF) at Indian Industries Association (IIA) Bhawan on Wednesday.

Titled Solutions for Health, Air Pollution, and Environment in Uttar Pradesh (SHAPE-UP), the workshop urged people to change their lifestyle and spoke of collective efforts to mitigate the challenges of climate change.

""Of all the patients suffering from lung infection that I used to treat in the 1980s, about 85% were smokers. But now, over 50% of my patients are non-smokers but have lungs resembling that of a smoker who smokes 7-8 cigarettes a day,"" said LCF founder and trustee Dr Arvind Kumar. Minister of state (independent), environment and climate change Arun Kumar Saxena suggested that reliance on solar energy and LPG gas for cooking instead of wood or stubble can bring a significant change.

ACS, environment, forest and climate change Manoj Singh said climate change was an issue of inter-generational justice.

""While physics and chemistry exist across our solar system, biological life is only on Earth. It is our collective responsibility to see what we are leaving behind for the next generation,"" Singh said. Another issue that came to the fore was emissions from the industries and the need to make manufacturing among the micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) greener.

""Don't penalise entrepreneurs. Help them with technological support by promoting bio-diesel or other technology. Ensure that we don't rely on diesel generators by providing seamless power supply,"" said IIA president Neeraj Singhal.

The event called upon people to adopt simple measures like quitting smoking, burning wood for cooking or other purposes and planting samplings.

""Civil society plays a pivotal role in bringing long-term behavioural change. Thus, their role becomes imperative in taking this message to the people and stress upon lifestyle changes that they can incorporate to mitigate challenges of climate change,"" said former director general at CRPF and patron at LCF AP Maheshwari.

Hindustan Times,EU's Global Gateway to be key part of new economic corridor IMEC: Ugo Astuto,,"NEW DELHI: The European Union's Global Gateway strategy for boosting clean and secure links in the digital, energy and transport spheres is set to be part of the ambitious India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) that will create a network of railways and ports, EU ambassador Ugo Astuto said on Tuesday. In an interview ahead of completing his tenure in New Delhi, Astuto said that collaboration between India and the EU for a coordinated European naval presence in the Indo-Pacific is set to grow to ensure that the region remains free and open. Edited excerpts:

As you complete your term in India, how would you assess India-European Union (EU) relations since the time you came to New Delhi and the cooperation between the two sides in diverse areas?

I think I was privileged to serve in India with the EU in the past four years because, in this period, we have seen enormous progress in our strategic partnership. Let's start with the India-EU summit in 2021 in Porto, which was an extraordinary summit because you had all the member states meeting the Indian prime minister, and there we had the momentous decision to restart the free trade agreement (FTA) talks. Another landmark was the visit of European Commission president Ursula Von der Leyen in 2022 and the very significant decision to start the Trade and Technology Council (TTC). The only other one we have in place is with the US. That's a clear element of the level of maturity of our relationship.

Then there was the G20 Summit and the decision on its margins to launch the India- Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor together with the US. So, if you look at this, you see a partnership which is going from strength to strength and it's also broader. Yes, we have the economic dimension, we also have the political dimension and then we have a dimension which is very important to India and the others - which is how to address global challenges like climate change and digital transition. On climate change, we start from the same assumption that we need to work with a sense of urgency, we need to adopt measures now if we want to avoid catastrophic consequences amid increasing global warming that goes beyond the 1.5 degrees.

Also, at the G20, the commitment made to invest in renewables, that's a very positive step. Clearly, it's never enough. It's important we work more on mitigation and on reducing emissions, With India, we definitely start from the same proposition which is important. On the digital transition, we share the same views that we need to promote innovation and preserve competition, but we also must act in a way that protects the rights and freedoms of our citizens. For instance, when it comes to data protection.

What I've seen in the past four years is a renewed awareness on both sides that it's not just that we must, but we can work together pretty well. I was told that the conversation in the Trade and Technology Council very much mirrored this new awareness.

How would you characterise the current status of negotiations on the India-EU FTA? What are the contentious areas? For example, there is the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and how do we get over the contentious issues?

It's a complex negotiation. We are aiming at an ambitious and comprehensive FTA and there are bound to be issues. But what I see is that we have had five rounds of talks so far. We have had progress. We had a very positive interaction between European Commission executive vice president Vladis Dombrovskis and commerce minister Piyush Goyal during his recent visit to India for a G20 meeting and then the high-level economic dialogue with Goyal. What struck me was the positive atmosphere during the discussions. We share the same determination to overcome problems. So, I think that both teams are consistently working to achieve a positive outcome.

CBAM is not a trade measure, it's about the environment. It's about respecting our Paris Accord commitments. We want to bring emissions down and the way to do that is to put a pricing on carbon emissions. But if we do that in Europe and if our high emitters move abroad, the overall global result does not change and we don't achieve our objective. That's the purpose of CBAM. We have set it in a way to limit it to the higher emitting industries such as cement and we have a transition period. For the next two years, there will be no levy, so that we can have an open conversation with our partners to see how best we can address any contentious issues. I've followed the discussion here in India about the creation of an emission trading system in India, and I think when that is in place, we will see that the actual impact of CBAM will be limited.

How is cooperation progressing in green development and renewables, including green hydrogen? What are the priorities? Where is the scope for ramping it up?

I'll refer to our common objective, which is how do we reduce emissions. We also need a greener energy mix, and green hydrogen is very much part of the picture. The European commissioner for energy, Kadri Simpson, was here around a year ago for an event with her counterparts and the minister for new and renewable energy on green hydrogen. It also brought together the industry from India and the EU. Then she was back during the G20 and had additional conversations, and from there, I think we are in the process where we are looking at concrete deliverables, where we can work together on green hydrogen. India has an ambition to become a major exporter of green hydrogen. We also have put the spotlight on green hydrogen as one of the future necessary dimensions of our energy mix. I think there will be a meeting of our objectives, which is in the making.

Has the Trade and Technology Council identified priority areas and which area do you think has the best potential for taking off? The MoU on IMEC talks about coming up with a roadmap within the next six months. What is the EU's role going to be in IMEC and will the EU's Global Gateway mechanism be one of the ways you can coordinate on this corridor?

The TTC discusses the nexus of trade and technology and in the first edition, I understand that in the ministerial segment, the focus was on the resilience of supply chains and on green technology. I think we are in a rather advanced phase when it comes to a memorandum of understanding on semiconductors. That's the first example of what we can do together and this is obviously relevant when it comes to resilience of supply chains.

On the IMEC, yes, Global Gateway is very much a piece of the puzzle. Global Gateway is about investing in sustainable infrastructure and we have set aside 300 billion euros for the period 2021-2027, and the purpose and objectives of this corridor chime perfectly with Global Gateway. So, the answer is yes indeed.

The conceptual framework of Global Gateway is that we need to bring together the EU financial institutions such as the European Investment Bank, the individual financial institutions of EU member states and private capital, and by bringing them all together, achieve the critical mass we need for meaningful infrastructure. It's not just about public funds, but also about private funds and working together for transparent, sustainable, inclusive infrastructure that responds to the actual needs of the people.

There has been some criticism of the G20 leaders' declaration in European countries and pushback from some G7 leaders. How do you respond to such criticism?

I would highlight a number of very important facts and principles in the text. The text is asking for just and durable peace in line with the UN Charter. The text calls for respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity. It says the threat of the use of nuclear weapons is inadmissible. It calls for the Black Sea Grain Initiative to be made operational. I think these are very important points reflected in the text. Let's remember this is a text that has been subscribed to by the whole membership of the G20.

How are the EU's plans to have a naval presence in the Indo-Pacific progressing? How can India and the EU work to ensure that the Indo-Pacific remains free and open, especially at a time when we are seeing China's assertiveness in territorial disputes with the Philippines and Japan?

India and the EU share a pretty similar vision of the future of the region, and we want the region to be prosperous and stable and be underpinned by respect for international law and the UN Charter. That's where we can work together, and we are working together. This means a holistic approach. It's not just security, it's the economy, it's working for economic development. It's about climate change and the digital transition, that's also relevant when it comes to the Indo-Pacific.

You mentioned the security dimension and there, I would like to refer to a new concept, which is a coordinated maritime presence. It's a new concept whereby the naval assets of individual member states can act in a specific region in a coordinated fashion. I think that's significant in terms of the added value that you can bring in terms of coordination and creating critical mass. India is very much part of the picture. For instance, look at the frequency of port calls by European naval assets. Most recently it was an Italian Navy ship, Morosini, that was in Mumbai. There was also a seminar devoted to the European visit of a coordinated maritime presence. But it's not the only example. Last year, there was a German frigate, the French are regular visitors. You also see the Indian Navy and EU assets undertaking joint exercises more and more. I suspect we'll see more of that.",2023-09-12T11:41:16Z
The Times of India,"Bihar, Jharkhand at bottom of SDGs as India slips 3 ranks | India News - Times of India",,"ALWAR (Rajasthan): Bihar, Jharkhand and Assam are the bottom three states in the country in terms of achievement of sustainable development goals (SDG) at a time when India has slipped three places from last year, primarily because of major challenges in 11 out of 15 SDGs, including SDG-2 (zero hunger), SDG-3 (good health and wellbeing), SDG-5 (gender equality) and SDG-11 (sustainable cities and communities) among others.

Odisha, which is also below the national average on most of the parameters, has, however, been successful in clinching the top position among all 28 states in SDG-13 climate action.

The report on achievement of the SDGs at the country level as well as individual states and Union Territories on a scale of 100 for 15 out of 17 SDG parameters, was released here by Union minister for forest environment and climate change, Bhupendra Yadav, here on Monday. The SDG achievements is a part of Down to Earth's Annual State of India's Environment Report 2022.

In the consolidated report, based on performance of states on 15 out of 17 SDG parameters (ranking does not include SDG-14 and 17 due to unavailability of comparable numbers) Kerala is at the top with a score of 75 while Bihar is at the bottom with rank 16, securing a score of 52.

Bihar and Jharkhand have exchanged the bottom position among 28 states in SDG-1 (no poverty) and SDG 2 (zero hunger) index respectively. Bihar is also at the bottom of all 28 states in SDG-4 (quality of education) SDG-9 (industry, innovation and infrastructure) and SDG 13 (climate action). It is below the national average score in almost all the parameters, except for SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation) in which it holds the fifth rank in the country with a score of 91.

Jharkhand the second last state in overall ranking, apart from being poorest in achieving zero hunger is second from bottom in SDG-1 (no poverty) and SDG 13 (climate action), third from bottom in SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy) and SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production). Jharkhand has, however, fared well on one parameter -- life on land (SDG-15) securing 8th rank with 71 points. This deals with forest cover, afforestation and wildlife health. In terms of gender equality also, Jharkhand with a score of 51 points is above the national average of 48 points and placed in 9th rank among 28 states.

Commenting on the state ranking director general CSE, Sunita Narayan said that the annual report assumes significance when less than a decade is left to achieve these goals. "" It is like a report card and every state should introspect where they stand,"" she said.",2022-03-03T14:39:00Z
The Times of India,"Cabinet approves India's stand at recently concluded UN climate meet, says COP24 outcome protects country's interests - Times of India",Vishwa Mohan,"NEW DELHI: The Union Cabinet - highest decision-making body of government - on Wednesday gave its ex-post facto approval to the negotiating stand of India at recently held UN climate conference (COP24) in Katowice, Poland where the country had strongly flagged its reservations on a key point while constructively participating in the global meet to ensure its final outcome.

Though India considered the outcome of COP24 a ""positive one"" which protected the country's long-term interests, it noted on record its reservations on the issue of Global Stocktake (GST) -- a process of assessing collective progress of countries on their climate actions as per their pledges under the Paris Agreement to check global warming through reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.

India felt that the aspect of 'equity' was not factored in properly on the GST decision in the COP24 outcome and therefore the matter needs to be discussed in the subsequent meeting.

The UN climate conference had ended on December 15 after adopting a rule-book for implementation of the Paris Agreement on climate change post-2020. The countries had therealso agreed to initiate the work on setting up new collective finance goals post-2020 from the floor of US$ 100 billion.

The government's statement, issued after Cabinet meeting, noted India's concerns. It said the country had expressed its reservation on the GST decision regarding the need for considerations of equity in output of the stocktake process.

The country noted that the 'equity' is an important part of GST process as per the mandate of the Paris Agreement to ensure that ""vulnerabilities, problems and challenges of the poor and marginalised are addressed"".

In fact, all developing countries including India have been insisting operationalising 'equity' in the periodic GST, arguing that their cumulative historical and per capita emissions are relatively quite low and they need to share equitably the remaining carbon space to meet their development needs.

India's approach at COP24 was guided by principles and provisions of the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement particularly the principles of 'equity' and Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capability (CBDR-RC).

India, therefore, argued that the actions of developing countries need to be supported by sustained and adequate means of implementation including finance, capacity building and technological support by developed countries.

""The adopted guidance operationalises the obligation of developed countries in providing means of implementation to developing countries and requires developed countries to provide detailed information to bring clarity on projected levels of climate finance,"" said the government in the statement.",2019-01-02T17:21:00Z
The Times of India,"CCP breaches convention on climate change, energy? - Times of India",Newton Sequeira,"Panaji: The Corporation of the City of Panaji (CCP) has all but forgotten about its commitment under the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy.

Founder and CEO of Earthsoul Bio Products, Perses Bilimoria, who was in the state for a few days to evaluate the steps taken by stakeholders to protect the capital's vulnerable status, found that not much had been done on ground to mitigate climate change risks.

Panaji along with Rajkot, Shimla and Gwalior are the four cities in the country chosen to participate in the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy. According to Bilimoria, Panaji is vulnerable to global sea rise and increasing emissions.

""The state needs to give focus to these issues,"" he said.

During the tenure of Shubham Chodankar, the Compact of Mayors and the Covenant of Mayors announced the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy, a newly merged initiative to bring these two efforts together. As per the commitment, the Corporation of the City of Panaji had to identify the vulnerabilities of the capital and set achievable targets which could help mitigate the risks of climate change.

""I took over as the mayor in 2016 and was not informed about Panaji being part of this initiative. Nothing has come to my notice,"" CCP mayor, Surendra Furtado said.

Commissioner, Dipak Dessai however pointed out that the corporation had taken several steps to identify the risk areas which would later translate into ""work on the field.""

CCP has commissioned consulting firm ICLEI South Asia to prepare a report on low emission development strategies and for the Asian cities, a climate change resilient network.

Dessai said that work was on to convert the public lighting to LED lights while it was also working to reduce emissions by introducing bio-diesel or LNG buses through the smart city route.

CCP officials also pointed out that the five-way method of segregation of waste and the elimination of landfill sites had also served as means to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.

The Times of India,France welcomes India's decision to ratify Paris Climate pact - Times of India,,"New Delhi, Sept 26 () France has welcomed India's decision to ratify on October 2 the Paris Climate Change agreement aimed at containing global warming by cutting greenhouse gas emissions.

French Minister of Environment and Energy Segolene Royal complimented Prime Minister Narendra Modi for deciding to ratify the ambitious pact.

The historic Paris Agreement, reached in December last year, will come into force after it is ratified by at least 55 countries, accounting for 55 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.

In a tweet, the French Minister congratulated Modi for the crucial decision.

French Ambassador Alexandre Ziegler also hailed India's decision to ratify the pact.

""Welcome decision by Hon'ble PM @narendramodi that India will ratify #ParisAgreement on Oct 2, birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi @PMOIndia,"" he tweeted.

The US has already welcomed India's decision.

Yesterday, the Prime Minister had announced that India will ratify the Paris Climate Change agreement on October 2.

During the Paris climate meet in December last, more than 190 nations had agreed on setting ambitious goals for capping global warming and funnelling trillions of dollars to poor countries facing climate catastrophe. It had set a target of limiting global temperature increases by two degree centigrade.

While western countries, including the US, had been supporting an early ratification of the pact, India had been seeking more time to complete its national processes, fearing that any hasty decision may impact its developmental projects.

The issue of India ratifying the Paris deal had come up for discussion between Prime Minister Modi and US President Barack Obama on the sidelines of the ASEAN Summit in Vientiane, Laos earlier this month.

Climate change is a vital aspect and one of the centrepieces of Obama's legacy and the US president has been quite vocal about the affects that climate change may unleash. He has often said vlimate change is the greatest long-term threat facing the world, manifesting itself as droughts, storms and flooding. MPB SC",2016-09-26T14:13:00Z
The Times of India,India has made strides in tackling climate change: TERI chief - Times of India,,"New Delhi, Apr 23 () India has made strides towards providing ""real solutions"" to tackle climate change, TERI Director General Ajay Mathur said today, a day after the country signed the Paris accord along with more than 170 nations.

""Since the finalisation of the Paris Accord, India has already made strides towards providing real solutions to the very real problems of climate change. As a developing nation, we have found that growth has presented us with a great opportunity to set in motion our strategies for addressing climate change,"" said Mathur, who is also a member of the Prime Minister's Council on Climate Change.

He said in its journey towards sustainable growth which ensures protection of the planet against climate change, India has learnt that real-time data and human and institutional capacity are absolutely necessary for proper implementation of any plan.

""These can be further strengthened when nations are able to learn from each other, share and build on each other's experiences and lend support, whether financial or in terms of expertise. Going forward, India believes these will be instrumental towards the success of our common goal of ensuring just climate action,"" he said.

India had yesterday signed the historic Paris climate agreement along with more than 170 nations, marking a significant step that has brought together developing and developed countries for beginning work on cutting down greenhouse gas emissions to combat global warming.

Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar signed the agreement in the UN General Assembly hall at a high-level ceremony hosted by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

Elaborating India's initiatives, Mathur said one of the country's first efforts to be rolled out has been the market-based LED lighting initiative. Since initiation of the programme, India has completed the replacement of 100 million incandescent bulbs with LEDs which has led to a ""major"" reduction in carbon footprint by cutting nearly 25 million tons of carbon dioxide.

Hindustan Times,Govts set to increase fossil fuel production leading to breach of Paris goals: Report,,"New Delhi: Governments plan to produce more than double the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting global warming to 1.5°C, a new report titled ""The Production Gap"" said on Wednesday.

They plan to produce around 110% more fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with limiting warming to 1.5 degree C, and 69% more than would be consistent with 2 degree C. Taken together, government plans and projections would lead to an increase in global coal production until 2030, and in global oil and gas production until at least 2050. This not only will lead to failure of the Paris Agreement goals of keeping warming under 2 degree C and preferably under 1.5 degree C, but also in conflict with the net zero goals many countries have pledged.

""Major producer countries have pledged to achieve net-zero emissions and launched initiatives to reduce emissions from fossil fuel production, but none have committed to reduce coal, oil, and gas production in line with limiting warming to 1.5°C,"" the report by Stockholm Environment Institute, The International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), United Nations Environment Programme among others states.

The new data in the report also clashes with expectations that global demand for coal, oil, and gas will peak within this decade even without new policies.

""""If global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions -- of which close to 90% stem from fossil fuels -- continue at the current pace, the world could exceed the remaining emissions budget compatible with a 50% chance of limiting long-term warming to 1.5°C by 2030,"" the report added indicating that the world is most certainly heading towards 1.5 degree C warming in coming years.

Many major fossil-fuel-producing governments are still planning near-term increases in coal production and long-term increases in oil and gas production. In total, government plans and projections would lead to an increase in global production until 2030 for coal, and until at least 2050 for oil and gas, creating increasingly large production gaps over time.

The report assessed fossil fuel production policies and strategies of 20 major fossil fuel producer countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Colombia, Germany, India, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Mexico, Nigeria, Norway, Qatar, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK), and the United States of America (US). Altogether, these countries account for 82% of production and 73% of consumption of the world's fossil fuel supply.

""While 17 of the 20 countries profiled have pledged to achieve net-zero emissions, and many have launched initiatives to reduce emissions from fossil fuel production activities, most continue to promote, subsidize, support, and plan on the expansion of fossil fuel production. None have committed to reduce coal, oil, and gas production in line with limiting warming to 1.5 degree C,"" the report added.

For India, coal production is on an increasing trajectory by 2030 but there is no data for oil and gas. For Russian Federation all three are on the rise. In US, coal is on a decline but oil and gas production is expected to increase. In China, coal is on a decline but gas production is increasing; in Canada both oil and gas are increasing; in Saudi Arabia and UAE also both oil and gas are expected to increase in production until at least 2030.

""We find that many governments are promoting fossil gas as an essential 'transition' fuel but with no apparent plans to transition away from it later,"" said Ploy Achakulwisut, a lead author of the report and SEI scientist.

""But science says we must start reducing global coal, oil, and gas production and use now -- along with scaling up clean energy, reducing methane emissions from all sources, and other climate actions -- to keep the 1.5°C goal alive,"" he added.

""The 2023 Production Gap report is a startling indictment of runaway climate carelessness. It reveals that governments are on track to produce more than twice the amount of fossil fuels in 2030 than would be needed to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. In other words, governments are literally doubling down on fossil fuel production; that spells double trouble for people and planet,"" said Antonio Guterres, UN Secretary General in a statement on Wednesday.

""Countries must phase out coal - by 2030 in OECD countries and 2040 elsewhere. And the G20 must take the lead in ending licensing and funding for new oil and gas. COP28 must send a clear signal that the fossil fuel age is out of gas - that its end is inevitable. We need credible commitments to ramp up renewables, phase out fossil fuels, and boost energy efficiency, while ensuring a just, equitable transition,"" he added.

""The UNEP Production Gap report exposes the glaring hypocrisy at the heart of global climate action. Countries that present themselves as climate champions on the global stage are betraying the spirit of the Paris Agreement by intensifying the climate crisis through increased production of coal, oil, and gas,"" Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network International, said.

Singh added that wealthy nations, equipped with the means and bearing the historical responsibility to lead by example, continue their dangerous addiction to fossil fuels.

""We must close the vast gap in the global climate policy framework with a binding commitment to halt new exploration and agree on a managed and equitable phase-out of fossil fuels. The time has come to shun empty words, shift from fossil fuel dependency to a just global transition, and hold the polluters accountable,"" Singh said.",2023-11-08T05:33:51Z
Hindustan Times,"Rich countries off track on climate action, says report",,"New Delhi: Only two developed countries-- Norway and Belarus are on track to achieve their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) for this decade, a new issue brief released by Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) said on Thursday.

Developed countries are projected to collectively emit around 3.7 giga tonnes extra carbon dioxide (CO2) in 2030, against the reduction goals expressed in their nationally determined contributions (NDCs) under the 2015 Paris Agreement, CEEW said.

""This represents a 38% emission overshoot, with the United States, European Union, and Russia responsible for 83% of this,"" the issue brief, published in collaboration with the TRANGOV project at Wageningen University & Research added. The report draws on developed countries' self-disclosed information in official climate transparency reports. Based on this information, the study assesses past performance, as well as ambition of- and progress towards the implementation of key climate targets.

The brief highlighted that mitigation efforts of developed countries have direct implications for the limited carbon budget available to developing countries, which need sufficient carbon space to address development challenges. For this assessment, authors used datasets officially disclosed by developed countries in their reports as submitted under United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) transparency arrangements. They have considered developed countries as defined as Annex 1 parties under UNFCCC.

""Currently, developed countries' NDCs for 2030 collectively represent a 36% reduction in emissions from their 2019 levels. This is less than the global average of 43% that is required to keep the 1.5°C target alive,"" the report added.

Between 1990 and 2020, developed countries reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 20%, in line with an agreed-upon collective target. However, a substantial part of this reduction can be attributed to the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and the high emissions of former Soviet countries in the 1990 base year, the authors have said.

Developed countries are projected to collectively emit 3.7 GtCO2e more in 2030 compared to what is pledged in their NDCs. Moreover, to achieve net-zero emissions goal by 2050, developed countries bank on drastically reducing emissions after 2030. Even if net zero by 2050 is achieved, developed countries would still consume 40-50% of the remaining carbon budget, it added.

""The numbers are clear - even in this critical decade, developed countries are not projected to meet their 2030 NDC targets. This failure has implications for the limited global carbon budget available now, especially for developing countries like India. It is also crucial for the Global South to have produced this analysis and not just rely on handed-down assessments that focus disproportionately on emissions of emerging economies,"" Vaibhav Chaturvedi, Fellow, CEEW in a statement.

""To fulfil their responsibility as historical emitters and financially capable economies, developed countries must do more than meet the global average in emission reduction,"" Chaturvedi added.

""The climate journey of developed countries - historical and proposed - does not show deep enough emission reductions to reflect climate leadership. This means that the burden to mitigate global warming shifts to developing countries, which is problematic in a context where financial support to developing countries to achieve this transition has not been forthcoming, as promised,"" added Sumit Prasad, Programme Lead, CEEW in the statement.

The issue brief recommends that developed countries enhance their NDCs and scale up climate action to bridge the projected 3.7 GtCO2e implementation gap by 2025.

What remains of the global carbon budget to keep global warming below 1.5°C is estimated to be about 500 GtCO2. This amount will be depleted by the end of the decade at the current rate of global emissions according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Around 40-50% of the remaining global carbon budget for the 1.5°C target would be consumed by developed countries even if they achieve net zero emissions by 2050, CEEW has projected.",2023-10-26T13:08:02Z
The Times of India,"India releases list of 75 eco-friendly actions to fight climate change, pitches for its adoption at global stage | India News - Times of India",,"NEW DELHI: As part of global LiFE - lifestyle for climate - movement, India has listed out 75 environment-friendly actions for individuals and appealed to people across the globe to adopt it as their contribution to collectively fight the challenges of climate change.

The country will also showcase LiFE as a theme of the country's pavilion at 27th session of the UN climate change conference (COP27) in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt from November 6-18.

It'll be the first global platform where India would pitch for adhering to those enlisted individual actions to sensitise participating nations about objectives of the Mission LiFE since its formal launch at Ekta Nagar, Kevadiya in Gujarat last Thursday. The concept was introduced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi while making the country's statement during COP26 at Glasgow in November last year.

The move will bring into focus the unsustainable lifestyle of rich nations whose excessive consumption of resources is considered one of the key factors behind high cumulative historical emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) that is responsible for climate change-induced extreme weather events affecting poor and developing countries the most.

Environment minister Bhupender Yadav, meanwhile, on last Friday urged the group of Like-Minded Developing Countries (LMDC) to join Mission LiFE movement, flagging it as a ""pro-people and pro-planet effort"" that seeks to shift the world from ""mindless and wasteful consumption to mindful and deliberate utilization"" of natural resources. India's neighbours China, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are among over 20 members of this climate negotiation group.

Yadav pitched for taking forward the objectives of the Mission LiFE while participating in the virtual ministerial meeting of the LMDC. The meeting was held to prepare a joint strategy for COP27 which is called the ""COP of Implementation"" (of actions on whatever the countries pledged under the Paris Agreement on climate change).

""The country's pavilion at COP27 will focus on 'LiFE' as a theme the way we had focussed on 'Yoga' in a big way during COP21 in Paris in 2015,"" said an official in the environment ministry.

The 75 comprehensive and non-exhaustive listed actions for individuals under 'Mission LiFE' are related to saving energy, judicious use of water, reduction of single use plastic, sustainable food system, waste reduction, adopting healthy lifestyle and e-waste handling.",2022-10-25T04:53:00Z
Hindustan Times,CO2 now 50% higher than pre-industrial levels: WMO,,"NEW DELHI: Carbon dioxide (CO2) measured at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA's) Mauna Loa Atmospheric Baseline Observatory peaked for 2022 at 421 parts per million in May. The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) on Monday said CO2 levels are more than 50% higher than the pre-industrial levels.

The CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere are in territory which has not been experienced for millions of years, scientists from NOAA and at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California San Diego announced on June 3.

NOAA's measurements of carbon dioxide at the mountaintop observatory on Hawaii's Big Island averaged 420.99 parts per million (ppm), an increase of 1.8 ppm over 2021. Scientists at Scripps, which maintains an independent record, calculated a monthly average of 420.78 ppm.

""The science is irrefutable: humans are altering our climate in ways that our economy and our infrastructure must adapt to. We can see the impacts of climate change around us every day. The relentless increase of carbon dioxide measured at Mauna Loa is a stark reminder that we need to take urgent, serious steps to become a more Climate Ready Nation,"" said NOAA administrator Rick Spinrad.

CO2 levels are now comparable to the Pliocene Climatic Optimum, between 4.1 and 4.5 million years ago, when they were close to, or above 400 ppm. During that time, sea levels were between 5 and 25 metres higher than today's offsite link, high enough to drown many of the world's largest modern cities. Temperatures then averaged 7 degrees Fahrenheit higher than in pre-industrial times, and studies indicate that large forests occupied today's Arctic tundra.

CO2 emissions come from burning fossil fuels for transportation and electricity generation, cement manufacturing, deforestation, agriculture and many others. Along with other greenhouse gases, CO2 traps heat radiating from the planet's surface that would otherwise escape into space, causing the planet's atmosphere to warm steadily.

UN climate change conference begins

The United Nations Bonn climate change conference opened on Monday where governments are expected to discuss mitigation, adaptation, support to developing countries - particularly finance - and loss and damage. It will also lay down the agenda for COP 27 to be held in Sharm El-Sheikh.

""We urgently require political-level interventions and decisions in each of these areas in order to achieve a balanced package. Doing so will send a clear message to the world that we are headed in the right direction. Because the world is going to have one question in Sharm El-Sheikh: what progress have you made since Glasgow?"" UN Climate Change executive secretary Patricia Espinosa said on Monday.

On day 1, there was a delay in adopting two issues in the provisional agenda of the Subsidiary Bodies (SBs) under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). These issues were the global goal on adaptation (GGA) and the Glasgow Dialogue on loss and damage, two issues of priority for developing countries, the Third World Network (TWN), an international research and advocacy organisation said on Tuesday.

The need for balance in the treatment of adaptation and mitigation was stressed several times by many developing countries and their groupings. While the GGA agenda item was eventually adopted as an additional agenda to be considered by Parties, the agenda item on the Glasgow Dialogue on loss and damage was kept in abeyance, TWN said.

The 'Glasgow-Sharm El-Sheikh work programme on the GGA' was established last year. During several meetings held before the official opening of the Bonn conference, Like Minded Developing Countries (LMDC), a grouping of developing countries requested that it be included in the Bonn meeting agenda. Developed countries however were not in favour of the proposal, TWN said.

10-member Indian delegation at Bonn conference

The global goal on adaptation aims to provide a system for tracking and assessing countries' progress on adaptation actions and providing adaptation finance. During an informal briefing for journalists by union environment ministry on Tuesday, a senior official said: ""Adaptation finance should be equal to mitigation finance. The developed nations do not want to invest in adaptation because the return on investments is low. But adaptation is a matter of existence for island nations and many developing countries. Going forward finance for adaptation and loss and damage will be very important and India will take this forward.""

A delegation of 10 officials from India are in Bonn for the negotiations, the official said.

He added that India will be submitting its updated nationally determined contribution (NDC) under Paris Agreement before COP 27 at Sharm El-Sheikh.",2022-06-07T19:37:00Z
The Times of India,There is far less support for climate policies in rich nations: CEA - Times of India,,"NEW DELHI: Chief economic adviser (CEA) V Anantha Nageswaran on Monday said that developed countries need to convince their public about the urgency to adopt climate change mitigation policies and observed that there is far less support for climate policies, including tax on fossil fuels, in rich nations.

Referring to the issue of funding by developed nations to poor countries to deal with climate change, Nageswaran said it was unrealistic because they have far bigger challenges to face at home.

In high income countries, there is far less support for climate policies, including tax on fossil fuels, he said at an event here.

While noting that when developed countries tell developing countries and emerging economies what they should be doing going forward, Nageswaran said there is an even urgent and more important task in their hands.

""That is to convince their own public of the importance of climate change mitigation policies.

""... they have far bigger problems to make climate policies work in their countries without hurting themselves fiscally,"" he said.

Citing a report, Nageswaran pointed out that while overall support for green policy is lowest in Denmark, France, Germany followed by Australia, countries particularly opposed to carbon taxes are Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany, the UK and the US.

""Therefore, when we look for funding support from developed countries, it is unrealistic because they have far bigger challenges to face at home,"" he said.

Emphasising that finance is of key essence, and there is a need to mobilise finance through public, private and multilateral sources, Nageswaran said, ""we should not jeopardise fiscal health of both developed and developing countries.""

He pointed out that post 2008 and post 2020, both developed and developing countries are facing huge debt burdens and therefore, debt servicing will become onerous as interest rates rise.

The CEA also pitched for greater investments in metals and minerals for renewable energy technologies, which are highly metal-intensive.

""Even if investment is made, we have to have an international regulator to be able to ensure that they are available to all countries if we want all countries to progress to net-zero emissions by 2050 or 2070 at the same time...imagine the quantum of these metals and minerals required,"" he noted.

He said infrastructure development is critical for the Indian economy and asset monetisation is about economic efficiency of assets.

Last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a bold pledge that India will achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2070 and asserted that it is the only country that is delivering in ""letter and spirit"" the commitments on tackling climate change under the Paris Agreement.

Modi had also said that India is putting climate change at centre of its policies and stressed on the need to include climate adaptation policies in school syllabus to make the next generation aware of the issues.",2022-06-06T18:17:00Z
Hindustan Times,"State did well in handling pandemic, says Governor",,"The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government handled the Covid-19 crisis well, Governor BS Koshyari said in his address on Thursday

The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government handled the Covid-19 crisis well, Governor BS Koshyari said in his address on Thursday. Issues such as the state's tackling of the pandemic, the response to the second and third wave, ability to attract investments despite Covid-19, and the response to climate change figured in the Governor's address to the state legislature which is considered a policy statement of the government.

Koshyari wound up his address abruptly due to sloganeering by members from ruling and opposition sides. The written speech was tabled in the House.

""The government was fully prepared after the first wave of infections in August and September 2020. As a result, when the next wave hit the State between March and June 2021, there were 4.50 lakh isolation beds, 40,000 ICU beds, 1.35 lakh oxygen beds, and over 15,000 ventilators in 6,500 facilitation centres. Testing facilities are accessible in over 600 laboratories,"" he added.

The Governor said the shortfall in medical oxygen was overcome by augmenting the liquid oxygen storage capacity and the additional 5,000 metric tonnes that was planned, while 2,700 metric tonnes have been created. ""A total of 114 new oxygen production projects are being set up in the State with an investment of ₹1,870 crore. This will increase our oxygen production capacity by 1,480 metric tonnes and make the state self-reliant.""

As per the Supreme Court's directives, Maharashtra had paid a compensation of ₹50,000 each to the kin of those died of Covid-19 in over 1.40 lakh cases, he said. ""Till date, close to 91% of adult population in Maharashtra have received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine and 70% of adult population are fully vaccinated. More than 57% of those in the age group of 15-18 have received their first dose.""

Koshyari also referred to various welfare schemes for those affected by the pandemic like health workers, orphans and widows, financial assistance for artistes and rickshaw drivers, and the Shivbhojan scheme.

""My government's financial decision-making was made more challenging due to the economic slowdown caused by Covid-19. This was further compounded as a result of non-receipt of GST compensation of ₹29,942 crore, which was payable up to February 18, 2022, by the Central government to the State,"" he said. However, despite the financial crunch, the state government managed to restart economic activities, attract industrial investments, and at the same time, took initiatives to protect the environment, he said.

""Despite the slowdown in the economy during the pandemic, my government signed 98 investment agreements under 'Magnetic Maharashtra 2.0', involving investments of ₹1.89 lakh crore and creation of 3.30 lakh jobs,"" the Governor said.

Koshyari further said that to mitigate the impact of climate change, the government had established the Maharashtra Council on Climate Change under the chairmanship of the chief minister and the co-chairmanship of the deputy chief minister. ""Recognising Maharashtra's efforts in tackling climate change, my government has won the 'Inspiring Regional Leadership' award as part of 'Under 2 Coalition Leadership Awards 2021' at COP26 in Scotland. I am proud to say that Maharashtra is the only State in India to receive this award.""

Under 'Majhi Vasundhara Abhiyan-I,' the government had planted 21.94 lakh trees and created 1,650 new green areas, resulting in 3.71 lakh tonnes of CO2 sequestration, he said. ""To create awareness of climate change among schoolchildren, it is developing an environment curriculum from standard I to VIII. Compared to last year, there has been an increase in electric vehicle registrations by 157%.""

He expressed the resolve to stand up for the rights of Marathi-speaking people in Maharashtra's border areas with Karnataka and strongly condemned the defacing of the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in Bengaluru on December 16, 2021, and the throwing of ink on the president of Madhyavarti Maharashtra Ekikaran Samiti in Belgaum. ""The many repressive acts of the Karnataka government against Marathi-speaking people of the disputed border areas are condemnable,"" the Governor said.",2022-03-03T19:00:00Z
The Times of India,Global Biofuel Alliance key step to self-reliance: President Droupadi Murmu | Ahmedabad News - Times of India,"TNN, Updated Sep","GANDHINAGAR: President Droupadi Murmu said on Wednesday that the Global Biofuel Alliance, unveiled during the G20 summit, will help make the country become self-reliant in the energy sector. She said the entire world is experiencing the negative effects of climate change and global warming, mainly caused by the use of fossil fuels.

President Murmu, who was in the state on Wednesday, launched the National e-Vidhan Application (NeVA), which will facilitate paperless proceedings at the Gujarat assembly.

She said that NeVA will turn the Gujarat assembly into a ""digital house"", and it can access and adopt best practices of Parliament and other state assemblies using this application.

""NeVA is a progressive transformation which will bring transparency and speed in the functioning of the Gujarat assembly. It will also contribute towards saving the environment,"" she said.

Addressing the assembly, the President said, ""Through the G20 summit, India has announced setting up of the Global Biofuel Alliance. Countries like the US and Brazil along with 12 international organizations are part of this alliance. After the International Solar Alliance, the Global Biofuel Alliance is an important step taken for environment conservation and for achieving self-reliance in the energy sector.""

Expressing concerns about the negative impact of fossil fuels being experienced around the world, Murmu said, ""To tackle this situation, G20 nations under India's presidency have agreed to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases by 43 per cent by 2030. This resolution by G20 nations is significant because the contribution of G20 nations in the total emission is nearly 80 per cent."" Murmu also said the representation of women in politics should increase.",2023-09-14T00:07:03Z

The three-day campaign, on climate change and youth in Dakshina Kannada district, was held at Government First Grade College and Sri Gurudeva First Grade College, in Belthangady on Monday.

Nagaraj Koove, an environmentalist and core member of the campaign, told TOI that the climate change and youth campaign was launched at Koppa on June 19. The team has completed 88 sessions so far. Colleges and schools in nine taluks - Belthangady, Mudigere, Sringeri, Karkala, Koppa, NR Pura, Kalasa, Thirthahalli, Chikkamagaluru and Karkala - are being covered. The first phase of the campaign is expected to conclude this month end, he said.

""We are all witnessing climate change and it is youngsters, who will be witnessing the impact and hence they need to understand the factors contributing to climate change. We are targeting students studying in high schools and higher classes, including professional courses. This two-hour programme includes a video presentation on climate change, followed by an interaction, and screening of a documentary on Karnataka's biodiversity and how climate change is affecting it. Topics such as the impact of climate change on agriculture and livelihood are touched upon. A pamphlet is distributed with details, including how to mitigate climate change and the session ends with a quiz. Opinions of students are also taken into consideration,"" he said .

Funds for this campaign are raised through crowdfunding. ""In June we released a campaign poster on social media. Several well-wishers have contributed to the cause. Youths and farmers are the backbone of this campaign . The first activity was on seed collection and building a nursery. Later, the youths and students will be introduced to nature photography and to more environment-related subjects,"" said Nagaraj.

The Times of India,"wmo:  Greenhouse gas levels rise further, claims WMO report | Ludhiana News - Times of India",,"BATHINDA: The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) greenhouse gas bulletin published on Monday paints a grim picture on emissions and stresses the need for stark, scientific discussions for climate-change negotiations at the UN climate conference COP26 coming up in Glasgow.

Claiming that the world was ""way of track"", WMO head Petteri Taalas said, ""At the current rate of increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, we will see a temperature increase by the end of this century far in excess of the Paris Agreement targets of 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial levels."" The WMO measured the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in 2020 at 149 per cent of the pre-industrial level, while it recorded methane level at 262 per cent and nitrous oxide level at 123 per cent compared to when humans began disrupting the earth's natural equilibrium in 1750.

The coronavirus-driven economic slowdown sparked a temporary decline in new emissions but it had no discernible impact on the atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases or their growth rates. As emissions continue, so too would rising global temperatures. Given the long life of CO2, the current temperature level will persist for decades, even if the emissions are rapidly reduced to net zero.

From intense heat and rainfall to sea-level rise and ocean acidification, rising temperatures will be accompanied by more weather extremes, all with far-reaching socio-economic impacts. The WMO chief said, ""The last the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was 30 to 50 lakh years ago, when the planet was 2-3°C warmer and sea level 10 to 20 meters higher. But there weren't 7.8 billion people then.""

The Times of India,'Rogue attitude' of US hampered progress at Bonn summit: CSE - Times of India,,"New Delhi, Nov 18 () The ""rogue and obstructionist attitude"" of the US ensured progress at the UN climate summit in Germany's Bonn city was extremely slow and the ""old divide"" between the developed and the developing nations remained, a green body said here today.

New Delhi, Nov 18 () The ""rogue and obstructionist attitude"" of the US ensured progress at the UN climate summit in Germany's Bonn city was extremely slow and the ""old divide"" between the developed and the developing nations remained, a green body said here today.

The 23rd meeting of the Conference of Parties (CoP-23) of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, which ended in Bonn on Friday, had no real headway in resolving outstanding issues on the agenda, according to an analysis by the Delhi- based Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).

A CSE team was stationed in Bonn through the conference.

""The US's rogue and obstructionist attitude in the CoP process ensured that progress was extremely slow and hampered on several occasions and the old divide between developed and developing nations remained,"" the analysis said.

The Bonn summit was the first UN meeting on climate change since the US President Donald Trump announced intention to pull out of the historic Paris Agreement on Climate Change in June.

The CSE, however, said that the US continued to dictate the terms of negotiations, blocked progress on equity and finance at the Bonn summit.

""Instead of working together and standing united against the US intransigence, the old bickering between developed and developing nations continued. This meant that the US continued with its business-as-usual obstructionist agenda in the negotiations and hampered meaningful progress on equity and finance issues across a range of agenda items, including stock take, accounting, enhanced transparency framework, adaptation, technology transfer,"" said Chandra Bhushan, deputy director general of the CSE.

Vijeta Rattani, another climate analyst at the CSE, maintained that the US announcement was only a political decision with no legal bearing on the Paris Agreement, which has almost no legal options to contain the United States.

""Ideally, the US, having made its anti-climate agenda clear, should not have been allowed under any circumstances to determine the course of negotiations. Unfortunately, that did not happen,"" Rattani said.

The main outcomes, CSE maintained, were the 'Talanoa Dialogue, earlier referred to as the Facilitative Dialogue.

It is about stock take of the collective efforts, the outcome of which would determine the next round of the Nationally Determined Contributions in 2020.

The Dialogue would contain a technical phase - where Parties would provide the inputs - and a political phase, in which the outcome would inform improving of NDCs in 2020.

The final decision of the CoP, however, does not provide the details of the content and scope of the NDCs, the CSE said.

Another outcome, the CSE said, was that the developing countries succeeded in bringing immediate actions and pre-2020 commitments into the limelight.

""India was leading the demand on pre-2020 action. Parties agreed that there will be two stock takes to discuss pre-2020 commitments - in 2018 and 2019 - before the Paris Agreement becomes operative in 2020,"" the CSE said. ""India's stress on pre-2020 actions is encouraging, but it is more in the nature of procedure than action. It will require more than the ratification of the Doha amendment to make developed countries raise ambition and support commitments. The big question now is how to ensure that the rulebook for Paris Agreement is fair, equitable and ambitious, keeping in mind the fact that the US remains active and obstructionist in negotiations,"" Bhushan added.

Hindustan Times,"Past 12 months hottest year-long period in history, India among worst hit: Report",,"New Delhi: Global temperatures set a new 12-month record, exceeding 1.3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels from November 2022 to October this year, a new analysis of international climate data released by Climate Central said on Thursday.

This is the hottest year-long period in recorded history, according to the analysis with 170 countries recording mean temperatures that exceeded 30-year normals.

Around 7.8 billion people or 99% of humanity were exposed to above-average temperatures except Iceland and Lesotho which recorded cooler-than-normal temperatures, Climate Central, a non-profit science and news organisation said.

The analysis using the Climate Shift Index (CSI) -- Climate Central's daily local temperature attribution system -- indicates that human-caused climate change significantly raised temperatures over the last 12 months. CSI applies a peer reviewed methodology to attribute climate impacts. It is based on a study that was published in journal of Advances in Statistical Climatology, Meteorology and Oceanography last year. For example, CSI level 3 indicates that human-caused climate change made those temperatures at least three times more likely.

The analysis looks at daily average temperatures and heat waves and includes data for 175 countries, 154 states, and 920 major cities.

Least developed countries and small island nations had highest exposure to climate-driven heat, but climate change touched every country, and intense heat waves were recorded in the US, Europe, India, and China.

Highest average CSI was recorded for Jamaica, with an average CSI of 4.5 out of a maximum of 5 in the past 12 months. This means that climate change had an extraordinary impact on the average person in Jamaica who experienced temperatures made more than four times more likely by human-caused climate change. Guatemala (4.4) and Rwanda (4.1), also had 12-month average CSI values above 4.

Also Read: 2023: The year that broke climate records

India recorded average CSI of 1 but the CSI increased to 1.6 between May and October this year. The large area of many of the G20 countries tends to mask the climate signal when looking at country-wide averages as is the case for India, the analysis said. Several Indian states recorded high CSIs during this year since May including Kerala (3.6), Goa (3.4), Andaman and Nicobar (3.3), Puducherry (3.2), Mizoram (3.0), Karnataka (3.0), Meghalaya (2.9), Manipur (2.8), Tripura (2.8) among others.

While the CSI averaged across the US population was relatively low, several US states also had high average CSI values including Hawaii (2.8), Louisiana (1.9), Texas (1.9) etc.

Also, in India, 1.2 billion residents -- 86% of the population -- experienced CSI level 3 temperatures on 30 or more days. In China that figure was 513 million residents or 35% of the population; and in the United States, 88 million -- 26% of the population.

""This 12-month record is exactly what we expect from a global climate fuelled by carbon pollution,"" said Andrew Pershing, vice president for science at Climate Central.

""Records will continue to fall next year, especially as the growing El Niño begins to take hold, exposing billions to unusual heat. While climate impacts are most acute in developing countries near the equator, seeing climate-fueled streaks of extreme heat in the US, India, Japan, and Europe underscores that no one is safe from climate change,"" he added.

The analysis comes days ahead of the UN Climate Summit (COP28) to be held in Dubai. One of the main deliverables of COP28 is the global stocktake (GST). GST is a review of collective progress towards achieving the purpose and long-term goals of the Paris Agreement.

HT reported on September 9 that the synthesis report of the first Global Stocktake released by United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change found that global efforts on climate crisis are falling short of meeting the Paris Agreement goals of keeping global warming under 2 degrees C (over pre-industrial levels) and pursuing efforts to keep it under 1.5 degrees C. HT had reported that this year the 1.5 degree C goal was breached temporarily on certain months.

""The GST is an opportunity for the world to reset the ambition and the cooperation agenda. I believe the GST should lay down a very ambitious pathway going forward but one that recognises a rule based international system and is based on common but differentiated responsibilities. GST is also an opportunity to correct the wrongs in terms of adaptation and loss and damage and to recognise the need for grant based concessional finance for the countries of the global South,"" said Sunita Narain, director general of Centre for Science and Environment and is on COP28's advisory committee.",2023-11-09T12:42:20Z
The Times of India,'There are no non-smokers in cities that are grappling with air pollution' | Lucknow News - Times of India,"TNN, Sep","LUCKNOW: There are no non-smokers in cities that are grappling with air pollution. In fact, living in a city that sees an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 140 is close to smoking 7-8 cigarettes a day. Lucknow, at least during the peak winter period, is one of the nine such cities in Uttar Pradesh.

These were a few of the disturbing facts that came to the fore during a one-day workshop on air pollution and climate change organized by the Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) and the Lung Care Foundation (LCF) at Indian Industries Association (IIA) Bhawan on Wednesday.

Titled Solutions for Health, Air Pollution, and Environment in Uttar Pradesh (SHAPE-UP), the one-day workshop primarily hinged on urging people for lifestyle changes and collective efforts to mitigate the challenges of climate change.

""Of all the patients suffering lung infection that I used to treat in the 1980s, about 85% were smokers. But now, over 50% of my patients are non-smokers but have lungs resembling that of a smoker who smokes 7-8 cigarettes a day,"" pointed out Lung Care Foundation founder and trustee Dr Arvind Kumar.

Expressing concerns over revelations made by Kumar, Arun Kumar Saxena, minister of state (independent), environment and climate change, suggested that reliance on solar energy, and LPG gas for cooking instead of wood or stubble can bring a significant change.

Manoj Singh, ACS, environment, forest, and climate change, went on to suggest that climate is an issue of intergenerational justice.

""While Physics and Chemistry exist across our solar system, biological life is only on Earth. But we are facing severe headwinds towards a catastrophe. Thus, it is our collective responsibility to see what we are leaving behind for the next generation,"" Singh noted.

Another issue that came to the fore was the emissions from the industries and the need to make manufacturing among the Micro, Small, and medium Enterprises (MSMEs) greener and bring accountability among the entrepreneurs.

""Don't penalize entrepreneurs. Help them with technological support by promoting biodiesel or other technology. Ensure that we don't rely on diesel generators by providing seamless power supply,"" noted IIA president Neeraj Singhal.

The following sessions called upon people to adopt simple measures like quitting smoking, burning wood for cooking or other purposes, and planting saplings. The discussions, however, stopped short of suggesting any concrete action plan to deal with major contributors of air pollution such as emissions from industries and automobiles and sustainable waste management.

""Civil society plays a pivotal role in bringing long-term behavioral change. Thus, their role becomes imperative in taking this message to the people and stress upon lifestyle changes that they can incorporate to mitigate challenges of climate change,"" said former director general at CRPF and patron at LCF AP Maheshwari.",2023-09-27T14:07:11Z

The Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), an agency established by the Ministry of Power to create awareness and disseminate information on energy efficiency and conservation as also help develop strategies and policies towards that end, has launched the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme to address the issue of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and mitigation of climate change in the country.

The agency has appealed to all stakeholders to actively participate and provide unwavering support for the successful implementation of the scheme. According to BEE authorities, the scheme is aimed at facilitating trading of carbon credits and incentivise and reward entities that reduce, remove or avoid greenhouse gas emissions.

The implementation of the scheme, came into force on June 28, underscores the urgent need to combat climate change and recognise the pivotal role of market-based mechanisms in achieving emission reduction targets. The Carbon Credit Trading Scheme assigns a value, known as a carbon credit, to each tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) reduced or avoided. These credits could be bought, sold and traded within the country's carbon market framework.

Director General of BEE Abhay Bakre has stated that introduction of the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme is a historic and flagship programme of the Union Government and it signifies a critical step towards mitigating climate change. ""By incentivising emission reduction efforts and establishing a market for carbon credits, the scheme encourages active participation from entities across various sectors in greenhouse gas reduction activities. The initiative will not only help India meet its emission reduction commitments but also create tremendous economic opportunities and promote sustainable development"", he explained.

The BEE has appealed to proactive States such as Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Kerala, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Assam, Haryana, Maharashtra, Punjab and others to play a key role in ensuring the success of the scheme. Recognising that such active participation would foster industrialisation, create employment opportunities and accelerate economic development, the BEE authorities said the country could pave the way for a greener and more sustainable future by embracing the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme.

The Centre has constituted National Steering Committee headed by Secretary in the MoP to oversee and govern functioning of the carbon market. It comprises representatives from various Ministries, emissions and climate change experts and members from the energy sector. As the administrator, the BEE will identify sectors with potential for emission reductions, develop targets for obligated entities under the compliance mechanism and issue carbon credit certificates based on recommendations from the National Steering Committee.

Further, the committee will also establish market stability mechanisms, accredit carbon verification agencies and maintain the necessary IT infrastructure and database essential for the market's seamless functioning.",2023-07-10T02:29:00Z
The Times of India, Larger section of Indian populace seeks actions to reverse global warming | India News - Times of India,Chittaranjan Tembhekar,"MUMBAI: A large (82%) Indian populace is either 'alarmed' or 'concerned' about global warming or favour climate and energy policies, reveals a new study from Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and CVoter International.

The report, titled ""Global Warming's Four Indias, 2022"" identifies four unique audiences within the Indian public that each respond differently to the issue of climate change: the Alarmed (54%), the Concerned (29%), the Cautious (11%), and the Disengaged (7%).

A majority of the alarmed population (54%) is the group most convinced of the reality and dangers of global warming. The Concerned (29%) are also convinced global warming is happening and a serious threat but know less about it and view it as a less immediate threat than do the Alarmed. The Alarmed are the most supportive of political and national action to address global warming and are motivated to take individual action.

The telephonic survey of 4,619 Indian adults (18+), was conducted from October 2021 to January 2022. The two smaller segments are the Cautious (11%) and Disengaged (7%). The Cautious think global warming is happening but are less certain of the causes and are less likely to view it as a serious, immediate threat that will personally affect them. They support climate and energy policies but are less supportive of national action and less motivated to take individual action compared with the Alarmed and Concerned.

The Disengaged know very little about global warming, rarely or never engage with the issue, and often say they don't know or provide no response to questions about it. ""One of the first rules of effective communication is to 'know your audience',"" said Dr. Anthony Leiserowitz, project co-lead at the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. ""This analysis should help governments, journalists, companies, and advocates better understand and engage their key audiences on the issue of climate change and its solutions.""

Global warming risk perceptions differ substantially among the Four Indias. For example, 93% of the Alarmed and 59% of the Concerned, but only 24% of the Cautious and just 1% of the Disengaged think global warming will harm themselves and their family either ""a great deal"" or ""a moderate amount."" The Disengaged are the most likely segment to say they don't know or don't have an opinion, report reveals.

""Majorities in all four segments have noticed changes in local weather patterns, including rainfall,"" said Dr. Jagadish Thaker, project co-lead at the University of Queensland. ""The report also illustrates how social and economic inequalities increase climate vulnerability among diverse Indian populations.""

The most favored policies across these three segments include developing a national program to teach Indians about global warming , developing a national program to train people for renewable energy jobs, and encouraging local communities to build check dams to increase local water supplies. Few of the Disengaged favor these climate and energy policies.

""The message from the Indian public is clear,"" said Yashwant Deshmukh, founder and director of CVoter International. ""Indians of all kinds are concerned about climate change, support climate policies, and want leadership from their governments.""

Dr Anjal Prakash, Associate Professor (Research) and Research Director at the Bharti Institute of Public Policy at Indian School of Business said, ""The report identifies four unique audiences within the Indian public that each respond differently to the issue of climate change, highlighting the need for targeted communication strategies. Additionally, the report illustrates how social and economic inequalities increase climate vulnerability among diverse Indian populations. These findings should encourage policymakers and businesses to take immediate action to address global warming and work towards developing sustainable solutions.""

Aarti Khosla, Director, Climate Trends said, ""Clearly climate is no longer a niche issue limited to the elite audience as was always believed. This report is a clear and loud signal for all stakeholders -- policymakers, businesses and civil society -- to organise themselves to respond to a population which is demanding urgent and informed climate action.""

Chandni Singh, IPCC Lead Author and Senior Researcher, Indian Institute for Human Settlements, Bangalore said, ""In countries like India, the pressing issue on climate change is not about convincing people it is happening but finding the money and institutional capacity to implement solutions that help us avoid extractive and unequal development trajectories that other countries have taken. Climate denial is not our greatest foe, but myopic planning is.""",2023-05-04T18:20:00Z
Hindustan Times,Focus on indigenous and local solutions to deal with heatwaves,,"India is no stranger to heatwaves. However, what stands out about the heatwaves this year is the remarkably earlier timing, and the large spatial extent, extending from the northwestern to the southeastern parts of the country. While the India Meteorological Department (IMD) suggests normal rainfall and the early-to-normal onset of the monsoon this year, it is time that concrete plans are put in place to deal with heatwaves and closely linked extreme weather events.

It is natural to ask, after any such extreme weather event, if it was caused by the climate crisis. Scientists, however, pose the question a little differently. It is analogous to concepts in epidemiology where any particular person's lung cancer can never be attributed, with full certainty, to smoking because we may never know if they would have contracted the disease otherwise. What we can tell is that smoking makes the occurrence of lung cancer more likely.

Similarly, the question in climate crisis attribution studies is whether, and by how much, human-induced climate change has made any extreme weather event more or less likely. The first such event to be unequivocally attributed to anthropogenic climate change was a heat wave event in Europe in 2003 that led to massive mortality. Temperature is also a weather variable on which scientists have maximum prediction confidence, owing to its relatively smaller variations across space and time as compared to other hard to predict variables such as rainfall.

If we consider two probability distributions of temperatures, one with the climate crisis and the other without it, with the mean or normal of the former increased significantly from that of the latter, it automatically implies that there is a higher probability of occurrence of what was earlier considered as extreme. The climate science community has reported overwhelming evidence that extreme events such as heatwaves are likely to become more intense, more frequent and of longer duration and extent in future, unless emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols are significantly cut globally. It is important to appreciate that heatwaves in India, such as the current event, have the potential to influence thousands of vulnerable and poor people who, to begin with, contributed very little to the climate crisis. Leaving such questions of social justice aside, scientists also believe that in the foreseeable future, several rich communities are also going to be negatively impacted by the climate crisis.

To plan for a climate-resilient India, several factors need to be considered. First, a system of heat wave forecasts and early warning needs to be in place. One significant positive step has been taken by IMD through its regular bulletins and the predictions on heatwaves.

There has been a successful diversification of the IMD's focus from prediction of the monsoon to disseminating accurate information about other important climatic events. Second, recognising heatwaves as a major disaster is long due. We still have a long way to go in building public awareness, particularly on how individuals and local communities can take care of themselves. When should schools be shut? What are the optimal ranges of temperatures that a household AC should be kept at? How long should one stay outdoors if that's unavoidable? What colour, texture and material of houses, roofs and even clothes might be better suited? Clear directives on such questions are missing.

It is heartening to see individual cities such as Mumbai and Surat coming out with their climate action plans. The Ahmedabad heat action plan appears to have been fairly successful in coping with the 2015 heat wave after the disastrous event of 2010. However, more action is required at federal and state levels.

Finally, we also need to focus on indigenous and local solutions in dealing with hazards such as heatwaves. India has a long history of respecting nature and climate, and many of our traditional practices set great examples of sustainable living. Saving, harvesting and recycling natural resources have long been a part of our culture, and we must do everything to protect them.",2022-05-10T15:30:00Z
The Times of India,Panel discussion on 'Women in Climate Action' held | Kolkata News - Times of India,,"KOLKATA: Ahead of the International Women's Day (celebrated globally on March 8), the British Deputy High Commission Kolkata supported a panel discussion on 'Women in Climate Action: The Future and its Scope' at the ADAMAS University campus in Barasat on Monday, 2 March.

The event was organised in collaboration with the South Asian Women in Media (SAWM) and ADAMAS University.

The UK is striving to become a gender-equal society. Like in India, progress has been made but there is still more to do. That is why the UK and India are working together on shared global challenges like empowering women as leaders and trail-blazers, building better and more economic opportunities for women, tackling gender-based violence and human trafficking, promoting girls' education and positive gender roles in schools and boosting climate resilience among women in rural communities.

This year, the UK is hosting the vital UN climate conference, COP 26 at Glasgow from 9-19 November 2020. This is an opportunity to make a truly global effort. In the run up to the world's biggest climate conference, the UK will hold a Year of Climate Action.

Monday's event on 'Women in Climate Action', held ahead of the International Women's Day, was one of the many such programmes that the UK is supporting in India to highlight the impact of climate change on women and ways to build climate resilience.

In his inaugural address at the event, Nick Low, the British Deputy High Commissioner to Kolkata said, ""This year the United Kingdom will host COP26, the vital United Nations climate change summit where we need the global community of nations to agree more ambitious action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Make no mistake - getting that agreement is a big challenge. But it's a challenge the UK will not duck. We are at a tipping point - early decisive action to repair the Earth or continuing as we are and doing irreparable damage. This is an opportunity to turn the tide"".

Low also said, ""On climate change as in so many other fields, the United Kingdom and India are working together as a Force for Good. That includes our work with the Ministry of Rural Development, Government of India, to incorporate data on climate change as part of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS). This will strengthen resilience to the impacts of climate change and promote livelihood security among poorer women in rural communities in India"".

""Ahead of the International Women's Day which is on 8 March, I'm delighted that the UK and India are sharing expertise to ensure women and girls can reach their full potential around the world and are partners in climate change mitigation and adaptation,"" the Deputy High Commissioner added.

Addressing the gathering, Professor Samit Ray, chancellor, ADAMAS University said, ""Tackling climate change is a shared responsibility for mankind. Let us all stand shoulder to shoulder and contribute to the establishment of an equitable and effective mechanism on climate change and work for sustainable development worldwide"".

Eminent environmentalist and activist T Vijayendra delivered the keynote address at the event. Poet, writer and activist Joya Mitra, pro vice-chancellor and dean, ADAMAS University, Jyotsna Yagnik and associate professor, Department of International Relations, Jadavpur University, Kakoli Sengupta discussed the future and scope of 'Women in Climate Action'.",2020-03-02T18:45:00Z
Hindustan Times,Climate change can  adversely impact India's living standards,Muthukumara Mani,"On the whole, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh - which already have higher rates of poverty and large tribal populations - are likely to face the greatest declines in living standards, with drops of more than 9 percent. They are followed by Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra.(Rajanish Kakade/AP)

Over the past decades, India has improved living standards and enabled millions to rise out of poverty. Yet, climate change can emerge as a slow-moving disaster, with profound implications for society and the country's march to progress.

Already, temperatures have risen considerably, and rainfall patterns are becoming less predictable. As expected, changes in precipitation have begun to alter the growing seasons, affecting agriculture.

What impact will these changes have on living standards across the country, who will be the most impacted, and what can be done to build resilience?

Most climate change studies focus on sudden disruptions caused by extreme weather events such as storms and droughts. Less understood are the economic implications of the long-term changes in weather patterns that are unfolding.

Our recent research looks at these gradual changes and finds that if nothing is done to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, around 600 million Indians could be adversely impacted.

While India may lose 2.8 percent of GDP on average, some parts of the country can see a GDP loss of over 10 percent.

Today, almost half of India's population lives in areas that are projected to become moderate to severe hotspots by 2050, where the impact of climate change is likely to be the greatest.

Although coastal areas receive much of the attention, we find that many of these ""climate hotspots"" turn out to be in inland areas - in central and northern India.

Seven of the ten most affected districts are in the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra, which has been attracting a lot of attention because of a spate of farmer suicides. The remaining three are in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh.

On the whole, Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh - which already have higher rates of poverty and large tribal populations - are likely to face the greatest declines in living standards, with drops of more than 9 percent. They are followed by Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra.

What makes the impact more severe in these regions is their greater reliance on weather-dependent agriculture and their general underdevelopment. Take for example, Ramanathapuram in Tamil Nadu, just 100 kilometers away from Jaffna in Sri Lanka. Although both districts have relatively similar weather, Ramanathapuram does not emerge as a climate hotspot whereas Jaffna does, because of its greater reliance on agriculture and the differences in other development indicators.

Nonetheless, much can be done to promote resilience. Increasing educational attainment, reducing water stress, and expanding the non-farm sector, with special focus on the most vulnerable communities, are a few key actions that can reduce the impact of climate change.

Although no single set of interventions will work in all hotspots, communities can be helped to adapt by developing drought-resistant crops, providing timely weather forecasts and climate risk assessments, promoting weather insurance, and facilitating greater market access for farm products.

In addition, the efficient use of energy, water, and other natural resources will need to be encouraged. Moreover, incentives will need to be provided for research and development in both existing and new technologies in the energy, water, agricultural, forestry, and livestock sectors.

In future, economic growth and structural changes to the economy will cause people to migrate to cities, leaving behind farms and fields that are sensitive to climate change. Although migration to towns and cities could help more of the rural population to evade the ravages of climate change, it will, in turn, lead to new climate impacts. For instance, urban populations will face a growing number of health risks, exacerbated by heat waves and flooding.

These climate effects are likely to be less damaging if countries meet their commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement. Given the uncertainty about the path that countries will take, it needs to be remembered that decisions taken today will not only make a difference to the quality of life of this generation, but will leave an indelible mark on generations to come.",2018-08-11T14:41:00Z
The Times of India,Govt approves ratification of Paris climate agreement - Times of India,,"New Delhi, Sep 28 () Paving the way for bringing the historic Paris agreement into force, the government today approved its ratification which will be formalised on October 2, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.

The nod by the Union Cabinet comes days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the move which is expected to give momentum to implementation of measures at international level to control global warming.

Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said that with this India will be one of the key countries instrumental in bringing the historic Paris agreement into force.

""Today the Union Cabinet approved the ratification of Paris agreement which is a historic decision. With the ratification, India will be one of the key countries instrumental in bringing the Paris agreement into force,"" Javadekar told reporters here.

The decision will further underline India's responsive leadership, committed to global cause of environment protection and climate justice.

Javadekar said that there were two conditions for the Paris deal to come into force.

The pact will come into force after it is ratified by at least 55 countries that account for 55 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, he said.

He said that although 61 countries have ratified the agreement till now, India's move to ratify it will bring the total emissions to 51.89 per cent.

""Because of India's push, now the world will ratify the deal soon. It will become irreversible course of action for humankind. It is a common resolve to keep temperature rise below two degrees Celsius. Now that target is achievable,"" Javadekar said.

Noting that the four-year period between 2016-2020 is also important, Javadekar said that India has played its part and now will remind the world community that their pre-2020 actions are also important.

During the recent BJP's National Council meet in Kozhikode, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said,"" There is one work left in the CoP21 (Conference of Parties).

""Ratification is yet to be done and India too is yet to do it. Today on the birth anniversary of Deen Dayal Upadhyay, I announce that India will ratify the decisions on October 2, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi."" China and the US - responsible for around 40 per cent of the world's carbon emissions - have already jointly ratified the Paris climate change deal that aims to significantly reduce global emissions, giving hopes that the landmark accord may come into effect by the end of this year.

The Times of India,"Poor worst victims of global warming, says Prez Murmu - Times of India",Manoj Chaurasia,"PATNA: President Droupadi Murmu on Wednesday said the global warming has its biggest impact on the poor and the deprived sections of the society although it has emerged as a major threat to the existence of the entire humanity.

Launching the 4th agriculture road map of Bihar in Patna, she said growing climate-resilient crops could prove a significant role in dealing with the global warming challenge. The Rs1.62 lakh crore road map envisages different innovative ideas for the development of agriculture and focuses on crops diversification, organic farming, and technological and scientific interventions to increase farmers' income.

Stating that a water-rich state like Bihar has received little rainfall in recent years, the President asked the people to pay attention to water conservation. ""Changes in the current farming pattern can promote biodiversity and reduce exploitation of water resources,"" she said.

She advised the farmers to promote organic farming and said the demand for such products is increasing in the country and abroad. ""On the one hand, organic farming is helpful in reducing the cost of agriculture and saving environment, on the other, it is also capable of increasing the income of the farmers and providing nutritious food to the people.

I am happy to know that the state government has created organic corridors in the districts located along the Ganges,"" the President said. Stating that agriculture had a significant contribution in the state's GDP growth, she praised Bihar farmers for adopting modern methods. ""Perhaps that is the reason a Nobel prize-winning economist had once described the farmers of Nalanda as 'greater than scientists',"" she said.

Murmu also noted the productivity of paddy, wheat and maize in Bihar has almost doubled as a result of the implementation of the last three agriculture road maps. She said agriculture and allied sectors employ almost half of the state's workforce. Governor Rajendra Vishwanath Arlekar said the farmers must be informed about the schemes launched for them and the provisions made under the agriculture road map, lest it gets restricted to the paper only.

He said PM Narendra Modi always talks about doubling the farmers' income. He stressed on making the farmers aware about the new technologies as ""only then they could double their income."" Chief minister Nitish Kumar said the state agriculture road maps have resulted in increased productivity of paddy, wheat, maize and potato. ""A Nalanda farmer left China behind in per hectare production of paddy while a village in the district set a world record in potato production,"" the CM said.",2023-10-19T02:40:30Z
The Times of India,Tata Steel aims to complete decarbonisation at UK plant in next 3 years: CEO Narendran - Times of India,"PTI, Updated Oct 1","NEW DELHI: Tata Steel aims to complete decarbonisation journey at its plant in the UK in next three years, the company's CEO T V Narendran said. As part of its decarbonisation plan, the company will shift to low-emission electric arc furnace (EAF) process from the blast furnace (BF) route which is nearing the end of life in the next couple of months.

India-headquartered Tata Steel owns the UK's largest steelworks of 3 million tonne per annum (MTPA) at Port Talbot in South Wales and employs around 8,000 people across all its operations in that country.

""Consultation process with the unions is going. We also need a number of (other) permissions. Some of the infrastructure needs to be upgraded. There is a lot of work that needs to be done. It has already started. We are hoping that in the next three years we should complete the entire journey,"" Narendran told PTI.

He made the remarks in reply to a question about the timeline for the company's decarbonisation plan, which Narendran had earlier said was not possible without a financial support from the UK government.

Replying to another question, Narendran, who is also the company's MD, said his company is engaged with a few European suppliers to source the new plant machinery.

It will largely be from European suppliers because technically most of the capital equipment suppliers are either in Europe or in Japan or Korea but this will largely be from Europe, he said.

Tata Steel and the UK government recently agreed on a joint investment plan of 1.25 billion pounds to execute decarbonisation plans at Port Talbot steel making facility in Britain.

Narendran further said of the 1.25 billion pounds, 500 million pounds is going to come from the UK government.

He said it's a milestone funding that we will get (from the UK government). The rest will come partly from internal resources as well as through borrowing.

The environment ministry has decided to use the same theme for COP28 pavilion to showcase the country's efforts to instill a sense of unanimity for addressing the global challenge of climate change.

The ministry - the focal point for climate change cooperation and global negotiations - accordingly proposes to hire an agency for the work of conceptualization and management of India pavilion.

""The objective of the proposed theme-based pavilion is to highlight various ongoing initiatives/ activities of the government as well as its strategies for mitigation and adaptation measures to tackle climate change,"" said an official who will be part of the negotiating team during COP28.

""The concept and design of the Indian Pavilion to be set up at COP28 shall offer a unique opportunity to showcase India's positive actions on climate change digitally as well as through exhibits and in the nature of panel discussions, presentations, conferences, interviews, press conference, short movies, documentaries, lectures, demonstrations, showcasing of exhibits, etc.,"" said an official note on the proposed pavilion.

The theme ""vasudhaiva Kutumbakam'' is drawn from the ancient Sanskrit text of the Maha Upanishad. lt affirms the value of all life - human, animal, plant, and microorganisms - and their interconnectedness on the planet Earth and in the wider universe.

""The intent is to convey a message for just and equitable growth for all in the world, in a sustainable, holistic, responsible, and inclusive manner. It also reflects India's approach of living in harmony with the surrounding ecosystem,"" said the note, released last week.

The theme of India's pavilion will not just be in sync with the G20 theme but it will also reflect continuity of the country's approach adopted at climate negotiations where India has consistently been pitching for how change in lifestyle and consumption pattern could prove to be an important tool in the global fight against climate change.

The approach was also reflected in the country's pavilion at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt last year where 'LiFE' - lifestyle for environment - was the theme, showcasing how Indian civilizations have practised and led sustainable lifestyles with eco-friendly habits and practices being rooted in the daily life showing respect for the natural environment.",2023-08-21T05:44:54Z
The Times of India,"In Run-up To Y20, Lessons On Global Issues For Pupils | Guwahati News - Times of India",,"Guwahati: In the light of the Youth20 (Y20) events in the city from Monday, students of various colleges in Assam have reached out to various schools and colleges in the last couple of days to educate them on issues such as global warming, climate change and soil conservation.

The team visited two higher secondary schools in Dhemaji district in upper Assam last week and held interactive sessions along with awareness activities. ""Our effort was primarily to make the students understand the concept of global warming and climate change. We did not cover economy as the targeted students were of Class VII, VIII and IX only. It would be difficult for them to understand the concept of economy,"" Medhi said.

The Times of India,"Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad among 20 cities facing worst vulnerability to ecological threats | India News - Times of India",,"BATHINDA: The Ecological Threat Report (ETR), prepared by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), featuring research from the Lloyd's Register Foundation World Risk Poll, found Ecological threats, such as rapid population growth, water risk, and food insecurity will be exacerbated by climate change, causing mass migration and conflict.

IEP is an independent think tank focussing to peace as a positive, achievable, and tangible measure of human well-being and progress.

The report, released on Wednesday, finds 56% of 228 countries and territories are facing extreme ecological threat. In 2021, almost 92% of the world's undernourished people lived in low to very low peace countries.

Since 2019, the world's concern over climate change has decreased by 1.5%. Citizens in three of the four biggest polluting countries China, India and Russia, have a low level of concern - while the air pollution costs the world $8.1 trillion annually, or 6.1% of global GDP, claiming 6-9 million lives.

Each year, the ETR analyses ecological threats to assess which countries are most at risk from conflict, civil unrest and displacement caused by ecological degradation and climate-related events. The main finding from the ETR is that without concerted action, current levels of ecological degradation will worsen, intensifying existing conflicts, becoming a catalyst for new conflicts, and increasing forced migration.

The report also found that South Asia is home to 8 of the world's 20 most unsustainable megacities (with population over 10 million), with half of these being found in India alone. Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Hyderabad are among the 20 cities facing the highest population growth and worst vulnerability to ecological threats. Delhi suffered the highest air pollution of these cities.

While India is the world's third largest polluter, only 38.8% of its population considers climate change to be a serious threat.

India and Bangladesh have seen 532 and 254 natural disasters respectively since 1981.

The report analyses ecological risk, societal resilience and peace for 228 countries and territories, 3638 administrative districts and 250 cities, assessing their ability to manage their challenges between now and 2050. It also highlights 27 'hotspot' countries, home to an estimated 768 million people, which face the worst ecological threats and have the lowest societal resilience.

41 countries are currently facing severe food insecurity, impacting economic development, public health, and social harmony, with 830 million people at risk. Severe food insecurity describes a state where an individual has exhausted their food supplies, and their health, nutrition, and well-being are at serious risk.

The number of undernourished people has risen consistently since 2017, increasing by 35% in 2021 to over 750 million people. Undernourishment, where a person's habitual food consumption is medically insufficient to sustain them, is expected to deteriorate due to increasing ecological degradation, rising inflation, and the Russia-Ukraine war. In 2021, almost 92% of the world's undernourished people lived in low to very low peace countries.

Food insecurity is connected to water stress, defined as 'when more than 20% of the population do not have access to clean drinking water'; without adequate water capture it is impossible to provide sufficient food. More than 1.4 billion people across 83 countries now face extreme water stress. Most of the countries expected to suffer increases in water stress between now and 2050.

There are currently 33 megacities, with the number expected to increase to 47 by 2050. Over 60% of megacities are in low peace countries. They have the highest population growth rates, poorest sanitation, higher levels of petty and organised crime, and pervasive air pollution. However, they lack the financial capacity and governance to adequately cope with these challenges.

Nine cities have over 20 times the maximum level of air pollution recommended by WHO, including Lahore, Kabul and Agra.

Steve Killelea, Founder and Executive Chairman of IEP, said: ""As we approach COP27, this report is a timely reminder that the costs of many of the existing ecological challenges will only be amplified by climate change. The world's current approach to the countries suffering the worst climate-related issues is not working; ecological threats are increasing and have systemic causes that require systemic solutions"".

""Governments and international agencies must invest in building long-term resilience to avert future ecological destruction, forced migration and conflict. Developmental programmes should focus on micro enterprises which capture water, improve agriculture and on value-added manufacturing. This will improve the lives of the people who are suffering the most.""

Climate concerns

Since 2019 the world has become less concerned about climate change, dropping by 1.5% to 48.7%. Regions exposed to the highest levels of ecological threat are on average the least concerned with climate change, with sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia as of greater concern.

In China, the world's largest polluter, only 20% of citizens believed climate change was a serious concern, falling 3% since 2019, one of the lowest in the world. The third largest polluter, India, scored poorly at 39% but improved by 3.7%. The US, the world's second largest polluter, showed slightly more concern than the global average, at 51.5%.

With natural disasters becoming more frequent, communities will struggle to recover before the next one occurs. This can lead to forced mass migration, said the report.",2022-10-19T09:17:00Z
The Times of India,Hot and coal: COP26 wraps up short of climate target but high on blame games,Toi Edit,"A success for India - is how Union environment, forest & climate change minister Bhupender Yadav described the UN global climate summit as it ended. And yet, India is facing a lot of criticism for pushing through a late revision in the Glasgow Climate Pact, which now has countries agreeing to ""phase down"" unabated coal, instead of ""phase out"". No doubt this is momentous language, as this is the first time coal and fossil fuels are being mentioned in a COP deal. But overall COP26 has failed to live up to its billing as the ""last, best hope"" to limit this century's global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. The blame games being played against this backdrop are poor in climate finance and rich in hypocrisies.

As their lion's share of cumulative emissions indicates, rich countries grew rich on fossil fuels and now they are also more comfortably placed to transition to renewables at scale. In the US stagnant electricity demand plus lower prices of natural gas and renewables have been shutting down the coal plants, and yet it hasn't presented any details to end coal, as if leaving the transition timeline all to the market. Contrast its situation to India, where IEA forecasts the largest increase in energy demand of any country over the next 20 years, where coal is plentiful, its mining employs over 2 million people, and sensitivity to the cost of capital for energy transitions is very high.

That rich countries continue to go slow on the Paris finance commitment bodes ill for the bigger ask being put up by developing countries now. But as climate change manifests around us from the seas to the sky, we don't really have the luxury of waiting around for outside help. India's Glasgow commitments, including meeting 50% of the electricity requirement through renewable sources by 2030, already reflect one of the most rapid decarbonisations of the sector in the world, but we can and should do much more, for our own sake.

Nuclear energy is one cost-effective alternative that we should optimise. It forms only 2% of the share of energy in electricity production in India as compared to 4% in China, 18% in Russia, 19% in the US and 72% in France. As for how much COP26 finally delivers, it completely depends on how different governments finally finesse their pledges. The goal of ending coal will depend on sincerity in phasing it down first.",2021-11-14T21:21:00Z
The Times of India,Pench implementing Rs21 cr project to restore tiger habitat | Nagpur News - Times of India,,"Nagpur: The Pench Tiger Reserve (PTR) in Maharashtra is in the process of implementing Rs21 crore National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC) project to restore degraded and unproductive land to not only creating natural ecosystem benefiting tigers and villagers, but also convert it into a carbon sink stock of 11,253 tonnes.

Pench is the first tiger reserve in the country to implement the project, which aims to restore wildlife habitat in 250 hectares, which was once encroached upon by settlers who were brought as labourers for construction of Totladoh dam. It also includes concrete structures of irrigation colony in 50 hectares.

""The restoration of this core area will involve meaningful livelihood options through eco-tourism. The improved habitat value will result in better wildlife density and sightings, thereby boosting eco-tourism,"" said Ravikiran Govekar, chief conservator of forests (CCF) & field director of Pench.

The four-year project is funded by MoEFCC and is being implemented by NABARD. Apart from Maharashtra, the present project is being taken up in Rajasthan and Telangana.

The project will involve dismantling old structures of discarded and demolished buildings, clear and collect all debris and take up additional soil and moisture conservation, afforestation works by developing meadows, nurseries and taking up Miyawaki plantations, seed collection and vermi composting.

""The project has also been linked to livelihood generation by implementing skill development training in various trades to youth and women in buffer villages, water conservation by restoring tanks and spread nature education,"" said Govekar.

Govekar added, ""Climate change is increasingly affecting the forest ecosystems apart from anthropogenic pressures. The rainfall and temperature changes are adversely impacting water resources and fodder availability as well as flora and fauna,"" he said.

The state action plan on climate change (SAPCC) has already recommended adaptation measures to tackle climate change impact by monitoring these habitats. ""In Pench, more than 250 hectares of forest land in core area has become unproductive and the idea is to restore it to its original form,"" he said.

The Pench hydroelectric project, an interstate project between Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh on the Pench river, was completed in 1964 and actual work started in 1974. ln 1975, Pench National Park was notified under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972.

The national park was notified as a tiger project in 1999 and the entire area was incorporated into the critical tiger habitat (CTH) in 2008 under the provisions of WPA, 1972. The dam and its associated structures were constructed over a period of 20 years and the project was completed in 1990.

The residents then encroached on the reserve forest in the adjacent areas and subsequent development damaged more than 250 hectares. However, Nagpur Bench of Bombay high court and Supreme Court ordered the encroachers to vacate the land. It was vacated from 2002 to 2018.

Apart from restoring 250 hectares, the government incorporated Ramtek taluka under Human Development Mission (HDM) and granted funds to strengthen village ponds (community water tanks) used for agriculture in buffer area of Pench and livelihood generation, nature education etc are proposed in this project. The soil health analysis will be done and species based on that will be selected for plantation.",2019-12-25T01:11:00Z
The Times of India,Week outcome likely of Paris meet: CSE - Times of India,Ajanta Chakraborty,"NEW DELHI: Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), the independent public research and advocacy think tank based in New Delhi (India), an avid and consistent CoP-watcher and analyst body, believes that the 24th Conference of Parties is heading towards a weak outcome.

CSE analysts attending the global negotiations say there are major disagreements between Parties on a wide range of issues (including minor issues) and there is little time left to bridge those disagreements.

""Considering that the Paris Agreement itself is a weak regime, having a weaker rulebook will make it inconsequential. This is something that the world cannot afford. It would a better choice to have no rulebook here at Katowice than have a weak, ineffectual rulebook,"" said Chandra Bhushan, deputy director general, CSE. Bhushan is heading the CSE delegation at the 24th CoP.

CSE is recommending that countries should work for another year to develop a consensus on a robust and meaningful rulebook and then finalise it by 2019.

Contested terrains

The disagreements at Katowice run across the entire rulebook. Major points of contest relate to the issue of differentiation between developed and developing countries:

Equity: There are a few elements under the Paris Agreement where equity between the countries has to get operationalised. These include communication on NDCs, ex-ante provision and review of financial commitments, and global stocktake on collective progress to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. The process of operationalising equity has become a serious bone of contention between developed and developing countries. Developed countries are opposing an ex-ante review of their financial commitments and operationalisation of equity in GST. In fact, there is not even a consensus on what 'finance' should mean.

Transparency: How would flexibility (less stringent reporting requirements) be reflected in the transparency framework is another issue of concern. While the US and EU have pushed for selective flexibility meant only for least developed countries and island states, India and China are demanding flexibility for all developing countries.

Reporting on NDCs: The current set of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are heterogeneous. There is a need for clarity and guidance on standards to make the NDCs standardised for easier assessment and comparability. However, there has been no agreement on common time frames, baselines, scope or technical duration of NDCs.

Adaptation and loss and damage: Developed countries have opposed provision of finance in implementation of adaptation communications while developing countries have sought parity of mitigation and adaptation finance. Developing countries are fighting hard for inclusion of loss and damage as sources of input under the Global Stocktake process, as also its inclusion under the transparency framework for reporting of action and support; developed countries are opposing it.

The discussions on other issues including new market mechanisms are likely to be pushed down to next year owing to greater technicalities and complexities in different countries' stances.

The IPCC Special Report on 1.5oC makes it clear that the 2oC threshold referred to in the Paris Agreement is more dangerous than previously thought, and that unprecedented economic transformation is needed in the next decade to keep warming under the 1.5oC benchmark. This requires rapid phase-out of fossil fuels and drastic curtailment of wasteful consumption. According to the recently released UN Emission Gap Report, the level of ambition needs to be multiplied five-fold to stay under 1.5oC. Even then, at Katowice, countries like US and Saudi Arabia are fighting over whether to welcome the IPCC Report or just take note of it under SBSTA. Further, there is not even a discussion happening on how to raise ambition, say CSE analysts.

""There is no discussion on how countries will revise and update their NDCs by 2020, which is critical to keep temperature increase within livable limits. ,"" says Vijeta Rattani, programme manager-climate change, CSE.

""The bottomline is that countries are sparring even on procedures. For example, they failed to reach a consensus on the adoption of the IPCC Special Report on 1.5oC, which was commissioned under the Paris Agreement. All this shows that countries are not ready and willing for a meaningful negotiation. In such a situation, forcing a weak rulebook in the name of consensus would be very harmful for the world,"" added Bhushan.",2018-12-12T12:56:00Z
The Hindu,Under water: How rising waters cost us all,"Annia Ciezadlo, Preethi Nallu","Cochin, India. In the morning, before she left for work, Ambika Thankappan called her son Arun to tell him their world was about to drown.

""Da, it's already flooded to the nearby villages,"" she told him in a calm voice, using an affectionate Malayalam word for boy. ""And it's starting to reach our village.""

""I'll be there in an hour,"" he replied.

Arun jumped on his motorbike and set off through the rain toward their home. But the water was already a foot and a half deep. And it was rising fast. If he didn't get there in time, it would swallow everything they'd worked their lives to build: their home and everything they loved, including Messi, their tail-wagging, face-licking yellow dog.

On a normal day, Arun would be working at a shop at the Cochin International Airport, in India's southwestern coastal state of Kerala. Ambika would be working at the same airport, collecting trolleys and lining them up for travelers; a man named Wilson Perez would be picking tomatoes in Immokalee, Florida; and in Toronto, two men named Klever Freire and Gabriel Otrin would be doing something that 81 million people, every day, without expecting to fight for their lives: taking an elevator.

But August 15, 2018-India's Independence Day, as it happens-was not a normal day for Arun and his mother. That morning, after three days of nonstop heavy rain, the water began to rise. And rise.

""I can never forget the 15th of August,"" Ambika said later. ""We never expected the water to rise this high."" And then she began to sob.

It took Arun a frantic two-and-a-half-hour ride, over flooded roads, to reach home. He was relieved to find their house still dry and Messi safe in the yard. So he went to check on their neighbors in the lush, green, low-lying acres behind the Cochin airport-the first airport in the world to be fully powered by solar energy.

But inside the airport, the water was rising. It was already flooding the solar panels. At around noon, it started to surge through the wall behind the runway with the force of water exploding from a dam.

Arun climbed up on the wall to get a better view. He stood for a long time, mesmerized by the violent, muddy rush of water.

Suddenly, panic kicked in. The water would reach their house within minutes. Messi, and everything they owned, would be swept away.

***

Until now, scientists have often framed climate change in terms of the future: cities that will be underwater by the year 2050, the year 2100, or the next 50, 100 or 200 years. But for a growing number of people across the globe, that watery future is already here.

A　landmark report issued by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on Monday, October 8 pointed out that our world has already warmed by one degree more than pre-industrial levels. Without ""rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society,"" the world's top climate scientists warned,　our world will exceed 1.5°C much sooner than we think-as early as a dozen years-which will increase the likelihood of floods, heatwaves and droughts.

""One of the key messages that comes out very strongly from this report is that we are already seeing the consequences of 1°C of global warming through more extreme weather, rising sea levels and diminishing Arctic sea ice,"" said Panmao Zhai, co-chair of the IPCC's Working Group on the physical science of climate change.

One of the most immediate, concrete consequences of those changes is flooding. As higher temperatures lead to sea level rise and more extreme rainfall, more and more people are already learning to live with catastrophic flooding. Many find creative ways to adapt. But it comes at a cost-first and foremost to them, but in the end to all of us.

Economists are still trying to calculate the long-term effects of our drowning world on global trade chains, national GDPs, household income and inequality. Emerging research suggests that the human and financial costs of flooding are already much higher, and much longer-lasting, than ever suspected. One recent study found that without large-scale structural adaptations, the total economic losses from river flooding alone will increase by 17 percent globally, thanks to climate change, over the next 20 years.

""If we're only adding up the direct cost of a flood on the houses that were inundated, and the price it took to bail those out, and the price it takes to repair infrastructure, and other things like that, then we're potentially missing large hidden costs associated with those floods,"" said Amir Jina, a University of Chicago professor who works with Climate Impact Lab, a collaboration between climate scientists, economists, data engineers and risk analysts that is attempting to comprehensively quantify the impacts of climate change.

Four years ago, Jina and another researcher, Solomon M. Hsiang, looked at the effects of hurricanes-of which flooding makes up a major part of the cost-on national incomes.""We found something which I think surprised a lot of people, even us,"" said Jina. ""Even 20 years into the future after a hurricane hits, you see a decline in their GDP.""

The people who live in the path of a flood, like Arun and Ambika, are often those who would normally be carrying out the small, everyday tasks that keep the global economy in motion. Because floods tend to hit them the hardest, it can take these families decades to recover. The damage to them will cost us all-even if we don't live anywhere near the sea.

""It's not just a coastal problem,"" pointed out Jina.""It's an everybody problem.""

There is a saying in Malayalam about Onam, the annual harvest festival: prepare your Onam feast, even if you have to sell next year's seeds to do it. The meal marks the end of the monsoon season-characterized by scarcity-and the return to a good life.

In a normal year, the Onam feast would be dozens of Kerala's famous dishes, served on a banana leaf with a pappadam and payasam, a ceremonial sweet pudding with nuts. Kerala suffered catastrophic damages during the flood. But one of the most significant losses was something intangible: Onam.

Aside from the immediate damage, each flood has a series of long-lasting and far-reaching effects-what risk analysts refer to as ""cascading costs""-that ripple outward through geographies, economies and lives. Some costs are tangible, and may be recovered in time; but the less tangible costs are often irretrievable.

""It's not difficult to replace a building or dry it out or do what you have to do,"" said Tania Caceres, a Toronto-based risk analyst who consults with large institutional real estate owners, investors and developers. ""But the downtime and the loss of productivity that the operation in that facility generates could have global impact.""

The Cochin airport is one such example. When Ambika found out her house was flooded and everything in it destroyed, she handled the overwhelming pain by going back to work.

For six days, starting on August 18, Ambika and hundreds of others-about 800 regular airport workers, she estimates, and 400 from other parts of India-worked continuously to clean the Cochin airport. It took 200,000 man-hours-about 833 people working around the clock for ten days-to fix it all.

By August 22, a week after the flood, the Cochin airport was mostly ready to go. But all the people who keep an airport running, like support staff, were not. With people's lives still in chaos-living in camps because their houses were uninhabitable, roads washed out, diseases like rat fever (leptospirosis) beginning to spread-the airport estimated that 90 percent of the airline and ground handling staff wouldn't be able to make it to work. After meeting with airline and ground handling agencies, the airport announced that it would remain closed for another week.

The Cochin airport estimated the cost of closing for two weeks at 2 billion rupees, or $27 million. But it will probably take months or years to calculate the impact of the lost Onam holiday season on the local economy. Normally, thousands of Keralites fly home from all over the world for Onam. But with the airport closed for two weeks, the entire tourist season was gone.

""Onam is the trademark celebration of Kerala,"" said Prasanth Nair, Deputy Secretary to Government of India in the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy. ""It's also the biggest shopping season. All the shopkeepers take advances and they buy more stock. Most of them would have stocked up in anticipation of a huge business, and you have this flood taking out everything. And unlike huge business concerns, these people wouldn't have insured.""

Even a relatively small flood can have unexpected costs months later. In the United States, the heavy rainfall from Hurricane Irma in September 2017 caused severe flooding in Immokalee, Florida. That happens to be where much of the country's winter fresh-market tomato crop is grown-and where Wilson Perez, one of the farmworkers who pick those tomatoes, happens to live.

Perez and his four-year-old son, José, spent a week huddling in a local high school with hundreds of others until the floodwaters went down. Afterwards, they faced the kind of devastation that is becoming more and more familiar across the globe: wreckage and muddy, garbage-laden waters that left the whole area smelling foul for weeks. Perez and his neighbors all got sick-especially the children. After being cooped up inside a shelter for what would normally have been their first week of school, the kids wanted to play outside. When Immokalee's tomato pickers finally returned to the ramshackle, overpriced trailers where they live, it was impossible to stop their children from jumping in the dirty water. ""They thought of it as the sea, a lake, or a swimming pool,"" said Perez. ""I told them it could make them sick. But they played; it's part of being a child.""

Most of the physical damage to fields and farmworkers was eventually repaired. But the disruption to fields and to farmworkers' lives delayed the winter planting season. Two months later, that resulted in a shortage of tomatoes-and that, in turn, led prices to go up as high as double across the country, from California to Illinois. ""All of a sudden by mid-November the market spikes up real high, because there's not as many tomatoes as the market was expecting,"" said Michael Schadler, Executive Vice President of the Florida Tomato Exchange, whose membership represents about 95 percent of the tomatoes grown in Florida. ""Pretty soon you go from a market that was maybe $10 a box, to $15, then $20, and then by mid-December, late December, it was up above $30 a box.""

As Jina, the economist, points out, the biggest loss from any catastrophic flood even to both businesses and people is simply what never happened-what economists call opportunity cost, and the rest of us might call the future: degrees never earned, savings never invested, small businesses that lost their chance to grow and thrive.

Ten days after the Kerala flood, on August 25, Arun and Ambika celebrated their Onam feast with two bottles of water and a packet of bread from a relief camp. ""I felt like crying,"" said Ambika.

Their house was full of mud. At least 483 people were dead. Rat fever was beginning to spread. Arun and his brother Abin spent days rescuing people from the water on homemade boats, then came home to find three blue kraits, a poisonous snake whose bite can be fatal, in their yard. Arun's brother lost his engineering textbooks-and his chance to study for his upcoming exams. When he saw the books destroyed, he burst into tears.

Collectively, Ambika and her sons had lost 18 days of work and $1,500 worth of goods: beds, printer, computer, washing machine, sewing machine, stove, motorbike, food processor, soda maker, radio and television.

Worst of all, their beloved dog Messi was gone. Since he never left the yard, he had to have drowned. ""We all were sad that he left us,"" said Ambika.

""Our hearts were broken,"" said Arun. ""Everything is gone.""

In Toronto, on August 7, Klever Freire and Gabriel Otrin were working late at the office when they did something that is normally perfectly safe: they took the elevator to the basement parking garage to check on Freire's car.

But this was not a normal day. A sudden, violent rainstorm had dumped up to 72 mm (2.8 inches) of water on downtown Toronto in just two hours. The elevator sank into the water with a whoosh and stopped responding. The emergency phone shorted out. The ceiling hatch wouldn't open. No matter how much the men pounded, the doors stayed sealed shut-ironically enough, a safety measure in cases of fire.

They couldn't get out; but the water could get in. It gushed into the elevator and started to rise.When it reached the top, they would drown.

A flood is nothing new; it is one of the oldest human stories. But in recent years, flooding has become more severe and catastrophic than ever before. Worldwide, floods are the most frequent form of natural disaster. And natural disasters have increased dramatically in our lifetime, thanks to changing weather patterns.

Nobody knows this better than reinsurers, the companies that underwrite risks-like earthquakes, floods, volcanoes and other natural disasters-that are too big for individual insurance companies to absorb on their own. According to analysis by Munich Reinsurance Group (Munich Re), the frequency of ""relevant loss events""-events that caused loss of life or a certain threshold of property damage, adjusted to the country's income level-has increased by a factor of three to four since 1980. Last year, 2017, was the second most expensive on record.

""We clearly see an increase in the number of natural disasters worldwide,"" said Ernst Rauch, Chief Climate and Geo Scientist at Munich Re. ""And almost all of this increase is coming from weather-related disasters.""

As the earth's temperature increases, its atmosphere can hold more water vapor. More moisture in the air means more sudden, violent rainfalls-and, paradoxically, more droughts. ""When you do have a rainfall, it's more intense, because there's more moisture in the air,"" said Andrea Dutton, an Associate Professor of Geology at the University of Florida and expert on sea level rise.

Warmer temperatures are also causing sea levels to rise. One main driver is thermal expansion-warmer water expands and takes up more space-especially since the ocean absorbs most of the earth's increasing heat. The other main factor is the increasing rate at which glaciers and ice sheets are melting into the sea. A recent study, conducted by 80 scientists from around the world, found that ice is being lost to the ocean at a much faster rate than ever thought before. By modeling data from satellite surveys over the region, they discovered that the rate of ice-shelf collapse had tripled between 1992 and 2017, setting off a kind of feedback loop that is expected to raise sea levels even faster than previously thought.

In cities by the sea, both of these changes-sea level rise, and more extreme precipitation-can combine to create even greater floods. Higher sea levels mean higher water tables; when heavy rains come, the rain falling from the sky cannot soak into the ground, because soil already saturated with seawater cannot absorb more water. ""In coastal zones where you've had sea level rise, the water table is higher,"" said Dutton. ""And so the water, instead of being able to percolate into the ground, is now being forced to sit on the surface or try to run off the surface.""

Today, 40 percent of the world's population lives within 100 kilometers (63 miles) of a coastline. And that number is increasing-also, in part, thanks to climate change. Increasingly, droughts are driving people in the countryside to migrateto the outskirts of the world's major cities, many of which-eight out of the world's top ten located on or near coastlines. The people who migrate to coastal cities often end up living on the outskirts, like the area behind the Cochin airport where the Thankappan family and other airport workers live. These areas tend to be more vulnerable to flooding.

Increased urbanization, combined with climate change and outdated infrastructure, all compound each other to make floods more intense and damaging. Much of the globe's infrastructure was designed for a world before climate change. Kerala's Idduki Dam was built in 1976. Parts of Toronto's storm water removal system was built as long as a century ago. But even the systems built in the past half-century didn't account for how much, or how quickly, the water would rise.

""They assumed that the storms of 2018 would look like the storms of 1970,"" said J. Marshall Shepherd, director for Program in Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Georgia, and an expert on weather and climate. ""And they don't.""

In Toronto, Freire and Otrin watched as the water in their office elevator reached their waists and kept rising. They stood on the railings. The railings broke. They treaded water and prayed and shouted for help.

Finally, they managed to pry a tiny opening in the metal sheets of the ceiling. It was enough to stick a cellphone through and get a signal to call for help. The two officers who responded swam through the flooded basement and pried open the elevator door with a crowbar just as the two men inside had a foot of air left to breathe. Luckily, the two men were healthy enough to swim back out through the flooded garage. But Freire was so drained that despite his lifeguard training, he couldn't make it out without help.

Freire and Otrin survived. But the image of two men almost drowning inside an elevator upended everything we think we know about safety. Building owners and municipal governments prepare us with safety protocols for fire, or acts of terrorism; but not, until now, for a more watery world.

""We teach them how to exit a building when it's on fire, but we don't talk to people about what to do when the building is flooded,"" said Caceres, the Toronto-based risk analyst.""If there was a bomb threat, they would know what to do. And we're less likely to have a bomb threat than we are a flood these days.""

***

Some cities do plan for flooding. As waters rise, one way to prepare is simply to accept that they can't be stopped-perhaps even to embrace them. Since King Canute, Northern Europe's port cities have had a long history of accepting the inevitability of water.

In Hamburg, the port city and shipping center in northern Germany, the River Elbe overflowed its banks and broke its levees in 1962, killing more than 300 people and destroying 6,000 homes. Since then, Hamburg built a massive, improved system of levees around the city. It also invested € 3 billion in HafenCity, a mixed-use redevelopment of the old harbor areas right along the riverfront.

By the end of this century, according to current projections, climate change could expose as many as 5 million Europeans to so-called hundred-year floods every year.In 2012, Hamburg's municipal government began to raise the height of the riverfront promenade from 7.2 meters to 8.6-8.9 meters, in order to protect against the storms of the future. At $86 million, the project will be expensive-but cheaper than the destruction caused by a flood.

""Compared to the cost of a city flooding, definitely,"" said Jan Hübener, an architect who has been working on the flood wall for 12 years, first at the world-famous Zaha Hadid Architects firm, which leads the project, and now as partner at studioH2K Architekten. ""I think for a city like Hamburg, especially downtown Hamburg-for such a densely-populated area, with all the infrastructure, with subways and lots of office spaces-I think that it's not an option to accept flooding here.""

Of course, it shouldn't be an option anywhere. Three weeks after the Kerala flood, on Friday, September 7, Ambika was still scrubbing mud out of her family's clothes by hand. Books on science and engineering basked in the sun on a woven straw mat. ""We're hoping that we can save them,"" said Arun.

But there was one small, good thing: Messi the dog. He lay stretched out, luxuriating in the shade underneath a table, wagging his whole body and scratching in the dirt.

Ten days after the flood, a nephew found Messi, half-starved and traumatized, and brought him home. He didn't recognize his family at first. But then Ambika called out his name, and he bounded over and jumped up on his hind legs to greet them.""After he came back, everyone was happy,"" said Ambika. At first, he was so emaciated that he couldn't eat without whimpering. So, they fed him biscuits until he could eat solid food.

""Now he's fine,"" she said, smiling, setting a plate of rice and fish on the ground for him to eat. ""He needs a share of everything we cook. A slight hint of smell and he'll start barking.""

They found out later that the neighborhood children rescued Messi when the water came. The children carried the dog on their shoulders to higher ground. They brought him food until the water covered that area too, and then he disappeared.

If a flood can be said to do one good thing, it was this: everyone helped each other. Hundreds of Kerala's coastal fisherfolk turned their boats into rescue vessels and saved thousands of people from drowning. They tied ropes between electrical poles for the elderly and children to hang on to so they wouldn't get washed away in floods. In Immokalee, Florida, people from all over the state cooked hot food and brought it to those trapped in shelters.

Meanwhile, 6,000 volunteers all over the world, many of them diasporan Keralites, were working around the clock to coordinate rescue operations remotely. From call centers in Cochin, Bangalore, Chennai and elsewhere, they identified and geo-tagged locations where people were trapped on rooftops or inside their homes, and dispatched rescue workers on the ground.

In disasters, people invent informal, temporary networks for helping each other. These outpourings of generosity are extraordinary, but they are not unique. Social scientists who study disasters find that people are actually more likely to help each other when disaster strikes than to look out for themselves.

""You had the tendency to go and fill up a bit of the river, even encroach upon a bit of the river, build your huge mansion there, and you thought that you did a smart job,"" said Nair. ""That's not the way we should be rebuilding here. You had even major projects being announced without giving much thought for the environmental impact. Let's not do that again.""",2018-10-09T13:40:00Z
The Times of India,Macron takes a dig at Trump; hails efforts of India - Times of India,,"New Delhi, Mar 11 () Taking a swipe at US President Donald Trump for backing out of Paris climate agreement, French President Emmanuel Macron lauded the efforts of India, along with other nations, for making International Solar Alliance (ISA) a reality.

New Delhi, Mar 11 () Taking a swipe at US President Donald Trump for backing out of Paris climate agreement, French President Emmanuel Macron lauded the efforts of India, along with other nations, for making International Solar Alliance (ISA) a reality.

However, Macron did not name Trump at the founding conference of ISA in the capital today. While hailing the 'Solar Mamas', a group of women solar engineers, he also referred to the countries which decided to leave the climate agreement.

Addressing the summit in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Macron said, ""Mr Prime Minister, You made a dream and we did it. It was about this International Solar Alliance. It was two years ago, it was just an idea at that time and we decided all together to act very quickly and today a big change"".

Expressing his immense happiness and lauding the efforts of Solar Mamas, he said, ""Our solar mamas did not wait for us. They started to act and to deliver complete results. They did not wait and stop because some countries (US and others) just decided to leave the floor and leave the Paris agreement. Because they (ISA nations) decided it is good for them their children and grand children. They decided to act and keep acting"".

The oblique reference was towards US President Trump's decision to pull out of the Paris climate agreement, which was signed by nearly 200 countries in December 2015 in an effort to curb global greenhouse gas emission and limit global warming to within 2 degrees Celsius.

In November last year, Syria signed the deal, leaving the US as the only country in the world not to support the framework deal to combat greenhouse gas emissions.

Interestingly, France is the co-host for the founding conference of the the ISA which is a treaty based international body with 121 prospective member countries.

As many as 60 nations have signed the agreement to join ISA, while 30 have already ratified the agreement and made it possible to make it a legal entity in December last year.

Macron said the countries at the ISA represent three-fourths of the world population. As much as 20-50 per cent of the population do not have access to power.

The joint goal is to have 1 TW of solar energy by 2020 for which ""we need USD 1,000 billion,"" he said. Today, heads of 23 nations and 10 ministerial representatives gathered here for alliance's first summit. KKS KKS BAL BAL BAL",2018-03-11T12:36:00Z
The Hindu,India rejects Trump's allegations on Paris pact ,Kallol Bhattacherjee,"India on Monday rejected U.S. President Donald Trump's allegation that it had joined the Paris climate agreement for a large financial incentive. External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj described the allegation as ""unreal"" and said India did not join the agreement for ""financial greed.""

""First of all, there is no reality [in Mr. Trump's allegation]. The Prime Minister has spoken about this issue and let me also emphasise that India has signed into the Paris agreement not because of pressure from any country nor for financial greed or fear of any country. We signed the agreement for our commitment to protection of climate,"" Ms. Swaraj said, explaining in Hindi the reasons for India joining the agreement.

""Worship of forests, worship of rivers, worship of mountains continue even now in India. These actions are part of India's ethos that are five thousand years old. These are all heritage of India. That is why I am rejecting the allegations completely and that is why India will continue to remain in the Paris agreement framework, whether the U.S. continues in it or not,"" she said.

Focus on visas

Ms. Swaraj also flagged growing focus on H1B visas in the U.S. as an Indian concern, and said the government was alert to the risks on this front.

""Since 2004 a cap has been in place for 65,000 visas. There are no changes in the lottery process and in visas for our Ph. D students; but, yes, we have concerns. I want to assure the country that we are in touch with U.S. Congress members and the Trump administration so that no amendments are brought to the law so that Indian interests are not hurt.""

She, however, downplayed the chances of growing disagreement between India and the U.S. affecting the bilateral ties after Mr. Trump became President. ""After the arrival of the Trump administration, India-U.S. ties have not diminished. Thrice Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr. Trump spoke on the phone. I spoke with my counterpart Rex Tillerson. Our Foreign Secretary met their officials. These meetings indicate that the Trump administration is trying to build the relationship between India and the U.S. as a relation of mutual benefit.

No Modi-Sharif meeting

The External Affairs Minister, who addressed the media to mark the third anniversary of the Modi government, said that as of now, there were no plans of a meeting between Mr. Modi and his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif on the sidelines of the SCO summit scheduled in Astana for June 8 and 9.

""As of now, there are no plans for any meeting... Neither from their side, nor from ours,"" Ms. Swaraj said, stressing that India was willing to resolve all issues through dialogue with Pakistan.

""We are willing for talks on all issues. Second, talks should be held between two parties. Third, terror and talks will not go ahead together -- these are our three pillars,"" she said.",2017-06-05T17:17:00Z
The Times of India,Mukherjee inaugurates first World Sustainable Development Summit - Times of India,,"New Delhi, Oct 6 (IANS) President Pranab Mukherjee on Thursday inaugurated the first edition of World Sustainable Development Summit (WSDS) here being organised by TERI with emphasis on the need to limit the rise of climate change.

""We need to follow a twin-tracked approach of limiting the rise of climate change while ensuring the existence of sufficient resources to meet our future developmental requirements. This objective mandates the efficient use of earth's natural resource,"" Mukherjee said at the event.

He also underlined India's position with respect to its climate change responsibilities.

""India is home to almost 18 per cent of the world's population. However, we possess only four per cent of the world's renewable water resources. Our energy consumption constitutes six per cent of the global energy consumption,"" he said.

""Large-scale utilisation of resources leads to their depletion and also impacts adversely on the environment. This results in reduced availability of resources for future growth putting a question mark on the sustainable development of an economy,"" he added.

Themed ""Beyond 2015: People, Planet and Progress"", WSDS has replaced what was earlier called Delhi Sustainable Development Summit (DSDS), which was also organised by The Energy and Research Institute (TERI). The first DSDS was organised in 2005.

Mukherjee also awarded Sikkim Chief Minister Pawan Chamling with Sustainable Development Leadership Award at the event.

He also advised the public to use energy resources discerningly and quoted Mahatma Gandhi as he did so.

""Our society must learn to exercise restraint in consumption while continuing to use resources in moderation. In this regard, I am reminded of these words of Mahatma Gandhi who once observed and I quote: The earth provides enough for everyone's needs but not for everyman's greed,"" he said.

New Delhi, Oct 5 () India is key to the success of the Paris climate deal, a top European Union official today said, underlining that it is crucial to have a ""deep dialogue"" with the country to ensure timely delivery of the landmark pact.

""India is a key factor in the success of the Paris agreement. It is crucial to mobilise and to engage in a deep dialogue with India to ensure a timely delivery of the plan by 2030,"" said Henriette Faergemann, EU representative to India, a day after the European Parliament overwhelmingly backed the ratification of the Paris climate deal.

""We have no time and need to get to task at the earliest. This will only work if multiple sectors are tackled simultaneously instead of in isolation,"" he said, speaking at the World Sustainable Development Summit organised by TERI.

TERI Director-General Ajay Mathur said, ""We are today on the day that follows the ratification by the European Parliament. Also the 30-day countdown to the Paris Agreement starts now. For the agreement to be effective, we need to ensure there is technology, financing, best practices and options for all.""

The summit from October 5 to 8 is also an attempt to initiate discussions on methodologies to be adopted in order to envisage a plan to realise the Global Goals beyond 2015.

The idea is to create a common platform for countries to identify opportunities for consensus and collaboration to balance the realities of ecosystem preservation with aspirations for a holistic economic development.

President Pranab Mukherjee will formally inaugurate the summit tomorrow.

Some of the key sessions deliberated today include discussions on climate resilient agriculture, valuation of energy costs in the context of India, mainstreaming affordable and clean energy, creating stronger linkages between climate risks and policy and practice amongst others.

Last December, more than 190 countries adopted the Paris Agreement. At least 55 countries representing minimum 55 percent of global emissions need to formally join the agreement before it comes into force.

India, the world's third largest emitter of greenhouse gases, on Sunday ratified the landmark Paris climate deal, giving a major boost to the deal which appeared tantalisingly close to enter into force by the end of this year. With India's move, a total of 62 countries accounting for almost 52 per cent of emissions have now ratified the accord. TDS PMS",2016-10-05T16:06:00Z

New Delhi, Sep 25 () The US today welcomed India's surprise decision to ratify the key Paris Climate Change agreement on October 2.

""We welcome the news India will join the #ParisAgreement October 2,"" US Ambassador to India Richard Verma said.

""Congrats Prime Minister @narendramodi for your leadership to #ActOnClimate,"" Verma tweeted.

Earlier, in a surprise move, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that India will ratify the Paris Climate Change agreement on October 2, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.

""There is one work left in the CoP21 (Conference of Parties). Ratification is yet to be done and India too is yet to do it. Today on the birth anniversary of Deen Dayal Upadhyay, I announce that India will ratify the decisions on October 2, the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi,"" he said while addressing BJP's National Council meet in Kozhikode, Kerala. Modi said he had chosen the date, which is next Sunday, as Mahatma Gandhi's life was an example of minimum carbon footprint.

During the Paris climate meet in December last, more than 190 nations had agreed on setting ambitious goals for capping global warming and funnelling trillions of dollars to poor countries facing climate catastrophe.

The pact will come into force after it is ratified by at least 55 countries that account for 55 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.

Talking about the need to ratify the COP21 decision, Modi said there is a looming threat due to global warming to many coastal countries and cities. Even Kerala, where the conclave was being held, is also a coastal area.

While Western countries, including the US, had been supporting an early ratification of the pact, India had been seeking more time to complete its national processes as it fears that any hasty decision may impact its developmental projects.

The issue of India ratifying the Paris deal had come up for discussion between Prime Minister Modi and US President Barack Obama on the sidelines of the ASEAN Summit in Vientiane, Laos earlier this month.

Climate change is a vital aspect and one of the centerpieces of Obama's legacy and the US president has been quite vocal about the affects that climate change may unleash. He has often said Climate change is the greatest long-term threat facing the world, manifesting itself as droughts, storms and flooding. AKJ ABH",2016-09-25T19:03:00Z
The Times of India,We are like frogs in boiling water: Author Amitav Ghosh on climate change (IANS interview) - Times of India,,"New Delhi, July 23 (IANS) The much-touted Paris climate conference is only about business and not about addressing environmental degradation, noted author Amitav Ghosh says, adding that these very businesses had created the present scenario. New Delhi, July 23 (IANS) The much-touted Paris climate conference is only about business and not about addressing environmental degradation, noted author Amitav Ghosh says, adding that these very businesses had created the present scenario.

""It's important that so many countries together believe that climate change is human induced. But what COP-21 does is creating the circumstances where people can make money. It's basically a new way of making business opportunities without recognizing that those businesses had bought us into the present situation,"" Ghosh, whose latest work is ""The Great Derangement, Climate Change and the Unthinkable"", told IANS in an interview.

He went a step further by taking on the international leadership on the issue.

US President Barack Obama ""talks about climate change and at the same time he has opened up areas for off-shore drilling. He has stopped just one project under pressure from environmental groups. He hasn't really oppose fracking. What we see is a global failure (to act),"" Ghosh maintained.

""The world is facing many and very critical problems which will grow exponentially. It worries me and should worry those who have children. What is this world that we are leaving for them, where every thing is being used up and nothing remains?"" Ghosh said.

""We know how climate-induced migration has shaken Europe to its core, and it has started in our country with drought. We are facing a planetary crisis and somehow, strangely, it doesn't seem to have affected the people's minds; they are unaware. This is something that worries him a lot.""

Surprised that the authors, filmmakers, thinkers and journalists have failed to do justice in dealing with this crisis, Ghosh asserted: ""No one is thinking at all. I visited a media headquarters and interacted with young journalists about this severe heat wave in north India that left many dead. I ask them how many stories they wrote on the issue and they said nothing.""

This is one of the major reasons, he says, that he wrote this book, hoping that it would serve the cause by bringing environment into the public conversation.

""It's like we are the frogs in boiling water which keep looking around but doesn't recognise that the water is boiling,"" he said.

Annoyed by the ""don't give a damn"" attitude of India's ""myopic"" political class, Ghosh expressed the view that in most policy matters, the present government is just a continuation of the previous dispensation.

""This year, due to this extreme drought, thousands of farmers committed suicide and more left Bundelkhand to live under the flyovers of Delhi. There was just one discussion in the Lok Sabha on it and only a few members (80/545) showed up. Now what would you make of our political class? It's like they had completely lost sight of what is fundamentally the most important issue for the Indians. They did nothing,"" he contended.

""If you think of our history, the first job of any rulers in India was always to look after the water -- they built tanks and canals. But now we are in a situation where our political class doesn't care about these things,"" he added.

Ghosh, in his book, also addresses the issue of insatiable cravings and limitless consumption -- a major contributor to climate change -- warning that the entire human race could even cease to exist.

""Its certainly perfectly possible to have a smaller carbon footprint. But that's not what we are thinking about. We are thinking of consuming more and more and more.

""Banks are pushing money at you, so that you buy a new car. I don't want a new car, but every time I turn on my computer they want me to apply for a loan. It's complete madness,"" Ghosh rued.

""We have created a machine that is driving us towards destruction and no one is able to change the direction. That's the sad reality.""

Even so, Ghosh thought there was a sliver of hope but quickly qualified this.

Referring to the ""Laudato si"" of Pope Francis, Ghosh hoped theology could be an answer to a much required awakening, but added: ""Unlike the COP-21 which was just technicality and jargon, the Pope has certainly done it, but what about other religions? If you look at the people who are spokesmen of Hinduism, most of them are actually the salesmen of something.""

""Unfortunately, the reality is that we will pay the price,"" he added.

Why so? Because Ghosh's new book brings to mind a homily: ""The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing"".

The Times of India,"From Berlin, Javadekar arrives home to cabinet rank, HRD - Times of India",,"New Delhi, July 6 (IANS) From holding forth on Climate Change at international fora to becoming incharge of the more humble Human Resource Development ministry - for Prakash Javadekar the change has been sudden, despite his happy elevation as cabinet minister.New Delhi, July 6 (IANS) From holding forth on Climate Change at international fora to becoming incharge of the more humble Human Resource Development ministry - for Prakash Javadekar the change has been sudden, despite his happy elevation as cabinet minister.

On Monday, Javadekar, who was in Berlin, was stressing on India's stand at the Seventh St Petersburg Dialogue on climate change, on the need for countries to take pre-2020 climate actions to curb emissions. He also sought cooperation among countries in finance and technology sectors to tackle climate change.

Javadekar, who was representing India as Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change (Independent Charge) in Berlin, was, in his own words, asked to rush back immediately by none other than Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Javadekar, the only minister in Modi's Council of Ministers to be promoted, received a phone call from Prime Minister Modi asking him to ""reach Delhi immediately"".

""I was abroad when Prime Minister called up and told me about it. He asked me to reach Delhi immediately,"" a beaming Javadekar told reporters at Rashtrapati Bhavan after the ceremony.

Javadekar, who was earlier slated to return to Delhi on July 6, said he had to change flights to arrive on time.

""I was away abroad and there was no direct flight to Delhi from there, but I reached here by changing a flight from Abu Dhabi,"" he said.

Javadekar has invited criticism for supporting the culling of animals and also been criticised by environmentalists who don't see him as environment friendly or sensitive to concerns. He had led India at the Paris climate change talks last year.

For Smriti Irani, who was divested of the Human Resource Development ministry where her every comment made news, her new portfolio of textiles is not considered eye-ball grabbing by any yardstick.

Giving a clear message that controversy is no substitute to good works, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday removed his one-time handpicked high profile Irani from the crucial HRD ministry and gave her the responsibility of a low-profile Textiles ministry.

This is a clear snub as Irani, a Rajya Sabha member, was personally chosen by Modi to run the HRD ministry in 2014 despite the move getting red flagged by the Rashtriya Sawemsewak Sangh (RSS).

The role of RSS in getting former TV actress-turned-politician Irani from the Sangh's one of the sought after portfolio is not ruled out as the Prime Minister carried out the exercise after repeated consultations with BJP chief Amit Shah and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley among others.

Shah reportedly reached out to RSS leaders an took their inputs.

In contrast to Javadekar, Smriti Irani has been mostly in controversies either against Congress, Trinamool Congress and Left leaders besides occasional skirmishes with the Sangh Parivar elements.

Besides found engaging in heated exchange of words with opposition members in Parliament, Irani did not quite go well with RSS leaders too.

Sources said during their both formal and informal consultation process, RSS leaders along with few members from Sangh-affiliated educational bodies reportedly often found that as the HRD Minister, Smiriti Irani was not quite easy to deal with.

In her two years as HRD minister, Irani stirred up numerous controversies, including because of her reported high-handed behaviour with university vice chancellors and professors.

The latest controversy under her watch - the death of Dalit student Rohith Vemula and jailing of Jawaharlal Nehru University students leader Kanhaiya Kumar - dented the image of the Narendra Modi government.

The death of PhD scholar Vemula in Hyderabad University and the arrest of Kanhaiya Kumar kicked up a storm, and Irani's handling of the two issues came in for criticism. The controversy also led to the intolerance debate, and many prominent writers and artistes began to return awards they had received from the government in protest.

Her over-zealous pitch for patriotism during the JNU issue prompted the Opposition to label her 'Aunty national'.

The decision of the HRD ministry to replace German with Sanskrit as the third language in Kendriya Vidyalayas in October 2014 turned into a major diplomatic issue.

The ministry was embroiled in a row in December 2014 when the Navodaya Vidyalayas were ordered to observe December 25 as Good Governance Day, which required the students to be present in school on a holiday.

Under attack, Irani clarified that the presence of students in school that day was voluntary.

Her own educational qualifications were also questioned after she took charge of the HRD Ministry two years ago.

She had also claimed to have a degree from Yale University, which the university denied, saying she had only attended a week-long programme.

New Delhi, Apr 22 () Terming as ""significant"" the signing of the Paris agreement by various countries, including India, Greenpeace today urged the government to galvanise political support to ensure ratification of the pact at the earliest.

On a day India, along with other countries, signed the Paris Climate Agreement in New York, Greenpeace India said the deal won't take effect until at least 55 countries representing 55 per cent of the world's emissions ratify it.

""The signing of the Paris Agreement is an important and significant step. We welcome India's desire to be a solution provider. It is critical to remember that the agreement won't take effect until at least 55 countries representing 55 pc of the world's emissions ratify it.

""Keeping in mind the constructive and leadership role India seeks to provide in this global process, we would urge the government of India to galvanise political support that ensures the ratification of the agreement at the earliest,"" it said in a statement.

The first three months of 2016 were the warmest on record - in February, as temperatures were a staggering 1.35 degrees Celsius above the long term average.

Kolkata, Apr 11 () Rising temperatures due to climate change will take its toll on tea production in Assam with Tea Research Association (TRA) fearing that cultivation will shift to higher altitudes.

According to preliminary findings of a study titled ""The Impact of Climate Change on Tea Growing Regions of Assam, India"", the predicted probability distribution of tea shows that by 2050 the suitability of tea growing regions in Assam will reduce drastically

Tea production could shift towards comparatively higher and cooler altitude areas, the study has found.

""The initial findings also identify new major opportunities for the industry such as new areas for tea cultivation due to shift in suitability of growing regions,"" said R M Bhagat, Deputy Director of TRA, Tocklai.

Preliminary findings indicate that the South bank region, parts of Upper Assam and Cachar are suitable regions, whereas the North bank region was comparatively less suitable.

Tata Global Beverages, as part of its association with Ethical Tea Partnership has commissioned TRA to identify and capture indicators of climatic changes that will impact India's tea growing regions in the next 50 years.

""By 2050, tea growing regions are likely to be severely susceptible to changing climate if measures for combating it are not adopted,"" Ajoy Misra, MD and CEO, Tata Global Beverages said.

""As an industry, we need to collectively take corrective steps to ensure that we conserve energy and other scarce resources,"" he said, adding a fast growing economy like India will need to focus on being an economic powerhouse and also a global environmental leader.

This project covers predictions on impact of climate change in the four tea production regions of Assam - Upper Assam, South bank, North bank and Cachar.

The predictions are being made with the help of existing baseline data along with the most recent UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report to create likely scenarios of tea growth in the four regions by 2050. The report aims at identifying areas that will continue to remain suitable for tea cultivation, areas that will require adaptation and those that may become unsuitable and hence may need to switch from tea to other crops.

""The US, which is articulating the inconvenient truth, while India is doing convenient action, uses seven times more coal per capita than India. Even on clean energy finance, the developed world has spoken a lot and done zilch,"" Goyal said on Saturday evening at a lecture here jointly organized by the Mahratta Chamber of Commerce and Pune International Centre.

""I am going to file 16 cases against the US for their violation of the WTO norms. Our international solar alliance rests on this. If a large country like India is subjected to this, then imagine what happens to the country in the underdeveloped world,"" he said.

Declaring that American obstruction and pressures would not be acceptable to India, he said: ""It amazes me that a country which talks of encouraging renewable energy goes to the WTO against India and says why did you put up 400 MW of domestically produced panels.

""You should have allowed us to compete even in those 400 MW, which India has domestically made and put up. They go to the WTO, win a case and tom tom about it as a contribution to renewable energy in the world,"" he said.

In the US, there are 16 programmes in different states giving protection to solar panel producers, which are completely in violation of WTO norms, Goyal added.

Calling the recently launched India-inspired International Solar Alliance a demonstration of India's concern for issues of climate change, he said the traditional ethos of conservation makes India a natural country to lead global efforts to tackle climate change.

At an International Finance Corporation event in New Delhi earlier this week, Goyal, who also holds the renewable energy portfolio, had urged the West to ""show some magnanimity"" and keep renewable energy out of the WTO framework.

""I don't see any reason why the West could not show some magnanimity and keep renewables out of the WTO framework, particularly when Indian manufacturers had such a large heart and had withdrawn the anti-dumping request, which had been ruled in their favour and could have imposed huge anti-dumping duties on the US,"" he said.

""My concern is that there is a lot of gap in what is being said by the West and what is being delivered. There is no denying for the fact that for last 150 years, the West has enjoyed low-cost fossil fuels and developed their economies,"" Goyal, who also holds the renewable energy portfolio, said at an International Finance Corporation (IFC) event here.

""I appealed to the US, when negotiations were going on, that we can keep renewable energy out of the WTO framework. After all we decided in Singapore that no country will put import duties on renewable energy, on solar products.

""I don't see any reason why the West could not show some magnanimity and keep renewables out of the WTO framework, particularly when Indian manufacturers had such a large heart and had withdrawn the anti-dumping request, which had been ruled in their favour and could have imposed huge anti-dumping duties on the US,"" he added.

Noting that most of the western world survived on coal, Goyal said coal consumption in the US, in per capita terms, is as much as India consumes in 2016.

""So, I think the reality is that West waited till it found cheaper sources of energy. Till shale gas become affordable, it kept talking about the inconvenient truth.

""So, it is not as if the inconvenient truth came out very late. We knew this truth 50 years ago also. New South Wales University started developing solar technologies 45 years ago,"" he added.",2016-04-05T19:01:00Z

All this is a a foretaste of a hotter, drier and wetter future, says an international researcher.New Delhi, March 22 (IANS) There is strong evidence that the Earth is already one degree Celsius hotter than at the start of the 20th century - and the past four years have been the hottest on record. All this is a a foretaste of a hotter, drier and wetter future, says an international researcher.

He said climate change is already happening and will continue to happen as more heat-trapping greenhouse gases and short-lived climate pollutants accumulate in the atmosphere.

""While mitigation is necessary to control climate change, adaptation is essential to face the hotter, drier, wetter future,"" Kathmandu-based ICIMOD's programme manager Arun B. Shrestha told IANS.

At the Conference of Parties (COP) 21 in Paris last year, the governments agreed to ""hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees"".

Shrestha said these commitments are highly ambitious but the plans developed so far cannot avoid a rise of three degrees Celsius.

UN weather agency the World Meteorological Organization said in terms of global averages, each of the past several decades has been significantly warmer than the previous one.

The period 2011-2015 was the hottest on record and 2015 -- because of a powerful El Nino phenomenon -- was the hottest since modern observations began in the late 1800s.

Along with the rising temperatures, climate change is disrupting the seasons and increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme events such as droughts and heavy rainfall.

And when it comes to the mountains, the indications are that changes will manifest in much stronger ways.

The Mountain Research Initiative, a scientific organisation that addresses global change issues in mountain regions around the world, warns that warming will be much stronger in high elevation areas, such as the Hindu Kush Himalayas, where the impact will be compounded by biophysical fragility and socio-economic vulnerability.

Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), along with its partners, has been conducting scientific research on climate change to support policy and action to reduce climate impacts and vulnerabilities.

According to a climate and water atlas, ""Mapping an uncertain future: Atlas of climate change and water in five crucial water basins in the Hindu Kush Himalayas"", the mountain range extending west of the Himalayas are warming significantly faster than the global average.

The atlas, published last year by ICIMOD, and two Norwegian entities - GRID-Arendal and the Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research (CICERO) - said the temperatures across the Hindu Kush will increase by about one to two degrees Celsius, in some places by four to five degrees, by 2050.

The atlas also warns that precipitation will change, with that in summer increasing in most parts of the region. The number of rainfall events is expected to decrease, but with more water falling during each event, causing both floods and droughts.

The Hindu Kush Himalayan region is home to 210 million people and provides water to over 1.3 billion people - more than the entire continent of Europe.

To counter mitigations of climate change, Shrestha, who is ICIMOD's programme manager for the river basins and cryosphere and atmosphere regional programmes, said adopting climate smart villages models, along with flexible and integrate farming with weather information is the right approach.

At the catchment scale, he said, community-based flood early warning systems like the one implemented in Assam by ICIMOD and its partners have increased the resilience of the people.

In addition to floods, droughts also need to be addressed through integrated drought management, the researcher added.

The Hindu,Four districts categorised as climate change hotspots,T. Nandakumar,"Kerala severely threatened by climate change, says State Action Plan on Climate Change
Alappuzha, Palakkad, Wayanad and Idukki districts are climate change hotspots in Kerala, with a high degree of vulnerability to natural hazards like flood and drought and impact on biodiversity and human life.
 The State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) has classified Alappuzha and Palakkad as the most vulnerable districts.  Palakkad is listed as very highly vulnerable because of the higher percentage of population relying on agriculture, a lower ranking in the human development index and higher social deprivation.  Alappuzha has been included in the same category because of the network of environmentally sensitive wetlands, lagoons and sandy beaches.  Idukki, Wayanad, Thiruvananthapuram and Kannur have been listed as highly vulnerable.  The two hilly districts are categorised as climate change hotspots because of the large area of dense forest cover and shola forest.
 The degree of vulnerability of climate sensitive sectors like agriculture, fisheries and forests, tribal population and low ranking in the human development index were also considered in identifying the hotspots.
 Kannur has been included in the high vulnerability list because of the extensive mangrove forests while Thiruvananthapuram makes it to the list because it has registered medium values in terms of all the indicators.
 The SAPCC, due to be taken up for implementation this financial year, assesses that Kerala is severely threatened by climate change.  The projected climate change scenario estimates that the atmospheric temperature across Kerala will rise by 2 degrees Celsius by the year 2050.  The minimum surface temperature in the Western Ghats region may rise by 2 to 4.5 degrees Celsius.  The number of rainy days is likely to decrease along the entire western coast including the Western Ghats.  Also, it is projected that if the sea level rises by one metre, 169 sq km of the coastal region surrounding Kochi would be inundated.
 The Department of Environment and Climate Change is preparing to implement the SAPCC from this year, Director P. Sreekantan Nair told The Hindu.  He said the programmes would be prioritised and implemented in a phased manner.  ""Discussions are on with NABARD, the funding agency identified by the Global Environment Fund (GEF).  We are also trying to find other sources of funds."" "" Mr. Nair said a monitoring committee would be set up to oversee the implementation of the action plan.
 The SAPCC report estimates that paddy production in Kerala would drop by six per cent with each degree rise in temperature.  The document says changes in temperature and rainfall would be detrimental to thermo-sensitive crops like cardamom, coffee, tea and black pepper cultivated in the high ranges.  The action plan recommends strategies focussing on climate-tailored agricultural management, integrated pest management, improved land use, organic farming, farm mechanisation, water use efficiency, weather forecasting, crop insurance and diversification of agriculture.
 In the animal husbandry sector, the report warns that higher temperature and changing rainfall pattern could enhance the spread of vector borne diseases and macro parasites, besides leading to the emergence of new livestock diseases.
 It estimates that heat stress and humidity variation could also have a significant association with bacterial, viral and other parasitic infections and animal diseases.  Some of the viral diseases such as goat plague may also reappear while the frequency of incidence of mastitis and foot diseases among crossbred cows may increase, the document says.",2014-03-19T21:04:00Z
The Hindu,'Indian scientists should address real-world concerns',,"India's ""formidable scientific firepower"" should focus on addressing ""real-world concerns"", particularly those of the poorest and most vulnerable, the former Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan has said.
 Mr. Annan citied climate change as one of the most ""pressing and complex"" problems.  Climate change is not just an environmental issue; ""Rising temperatures, changing rainfall patterns and extreme weather events are an all-encompassing threat to our food and water supplies, our health and security,"" he said here on Saturday.
 Efforts to mitigate the impact of climate change would require ""a fundamental revision of how we manage our economies, societies and the environment"".  ""And crucially, it will require us to harness the power of science, innovation and technology,"" he said.  Clean energy sources must be identified, new ways of production developed to reduce waste, and new treatments found to tackle disease, he added.
 Mr. Annan was delivering the keynote address at the Infosys Prize 2013 award ceremony, where seven scientists and social scientists were honoured for their work.
 Commending India for ""its determination to increase investment in R&D to 2 per cent of GDP from its present 0.25 per cent"", and to expand to 30 per cent the number of young people going to university, Mr. Annan said that today 40 per cent of all researchers in the world are in Asia and the Pacific.  ""This is a huge opportunity to overcome the traditional dominance in science of the mature economies."" ""
He, however, cautioned that governments should ""ensure that scientific research is not exploitative"", and that it is guided by ethical values.  ""Perhaps most importantly, they must develop fair intellectual property regimes, which enable and encourage, rather than stifle innovation.  And ensure that such regimes do not privilege the private sector at the expense of vulnerable communities...  When these conditions exist, we see some of the greatest gains in overcoming hunger, poor health and delivering sustainable development."" ""
The Infosys Prize 2013 was awarded to seven scientists and social scientists in six categories: V. Ramgopal Rao, Institute Chair Professor, Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai (engineering and computer science category); Rajesh Gokhale, Director, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research -- Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi (life sciences); Rahul Pandharipande, Professor, Department of Mathematics, Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, Zürich (mathematical sciences); Shiraz Naval Minwalla, Professor, Department of Theoretical Physics, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai (physical sciences); Aninhalli R. Vasavi, Senior Fellow, Nehru Memorial Museum and Library, New Delhi (social sciences).
 In the humanities category, the prize was shared by Nayanjot Lahiri, Professor in Department of History, University of Delhi (for archaeology); and Ayesha Kidwai, Professor, Centre for Linguistics, School of Language, Literature and Culture Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University (for linguistics)
The Infosys Prize is awarded under the aegis of the Infosys Science Foundation and includes purse of Rs.  55 lakh for each category, a medallion and a citation certificate.",2014-02-09T06:35:00Z
Hindustan Times,COP28 chief: Oil and gas sector needs to align with net-zero emissions by 2050,,"New Delhi: The global oil and gas industry needs to align with net-zero emissions by 2050, and ensure there are zero emissions of methane and routine flaring is eliminated by 2030, Sultan Al Jaber, president-designate of the United Nations climate summit (COP 28) to be held later this year, urged on Monday.

Al Jaber, who is also CEO of Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, welcomed action by over 20 oil and gas companies to take steps to fight climate crisis.

""Economies currently run on the equivalent of 250 million barrels of oil, gas, and coal every single day, which we need to either replace or decarbonise,"" he said at the Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition & Conference. ""The monumental task will require a system wide transformation of entire economies, a complete paradigm shift and not business as usual.""

Al Jaber's call came a day after convening meetings of both demand and supply side businesses in Abu Dhabi.

The United Arab Emirates will host the annual climate summit that begins on November 30 in Dubai.

""We must re-imagine the relationship between producers and the heaviest consuming countries and sectors,"" Al Jaber said. ""Industries can and must act. But they can't act alone. Governments should be proactive in setting the right demand signals and dealing with critical issues like permitting.""

Discussing the immediate steps he expects the oil and gas industry to take, Al Jaber said: ""Eliminating methane leaks and flaring is the fastest way to make the biggest impact on operational emissions in the short term.""

One of the issues likely to blow up at the summit is the silence on fossil fuel phase out or phase down. The Delhi Declaration of G20 addressed the concerns of petroleum states, of which the UAE is one, even as it expressed ambition to meet Paris climate pact goals by committing to global net-zero emissions by mid-century, HT reported on September 11.

Operationalising the loss and damage fund and setting out an energy pathway to keep the Paris Agreement goal of containing global temperature rise within 1.5°C are among the key parameters to determine the success of the upcoming summit, HT reported on Monday. The outcomes of the conference are particularly important because the combination of climate crisis and El Nino is leading to record global land and sea surface temperatures.

""We have spent a lot of time with partners, listening to them to understand where we can find success at COP28. In terms of negotiated outcomes, we need to deliver on the Global Stocktake, the Global Goal on Adaptation and operationalisation of the Loss and Damage fund. Those are mandated outcomes as well as the just transition work that we have to deliver,"" Majid Al Suwaidi, COP28 director-general from the UAE, said during a briefing last week.

""COP28 president-designate Dr Sultan Al Jaber's efforts to involve everyone and advocate for leadership in setting ambitious decarbonisation targets are noteworthy. However, the looming billion-dollar question remains -- can we place our trust in those companies that have, for decades, concealed the truth and fostered disinformation to delay essential climate action?

""The stark reality is that Big Oil, fully aware of their significant contribution to the climate crisis, persistently expands fossil fuel extraction while scaling back their already scant investments in renewable energy. Their track record is undeniably dreadful. It is imperative that governments exhibit courage to enact stringent regulations and levy new taxes to ensure compliance, rather than wasting precious time in unproductive consultations and persuasions. The revenue generated from such endeavors must be allocated to facilitate a just energy transition and address loss and damage in developing nations,"" Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network International, said.

COP28 is short for the 28th conference of parties, where parties denote the countries that are signatories to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.",2023-10-03T02:24:53Z
The Times of India,National Alliance to spearhead decarbonisation efforts across energy sector in Bengal | Kolkata News - Times of India,Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay,"KOLKATA: The Decarbonisation India Alliance (DIA) has officially launched its mission to combat greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) in the energy sector of Bengal, with the aim of accelerating Bengal's journey towards a carbon-neutral future. This initiative, led by the Society of Energy Engineers and Managers (SEEM) in collaboration with numerous organizations, was unveiled during the SEEM India Energy Conclave and Awards 2023 in New Delhi.

The Decarbonisation India Alliance brings together a diverse array of stakeholders, including prominent industries, manufacturers of energy-efficient products, service providers, and policy organizations. Notable members of the alliance include SEEM, Asar Social Impact Advisors, Carbon Market Association of India (CMAI), AMOS Group, Sonel, India Blockchain Alliance (IBA), Janitza, as well as various NGOs, industries, and facilities.

Priya Pillai, Director of Asar, an environment advocacy group, expressed the transformative nature of DIA, highlighting its mission to significantly reduce Bengal's carbon footprint and inspire action among industry stakeholders, particularly in the energy sector. The alliance aims to drive substantial reductions in GHG emissions, creating a sustainable development model that can serve as a nationwide example. Pillai emphasised that this alliance represents a collective commitment to a greener, cleaner, and more sustainable future for all.

West Bengal has witnessed a gradual increase in per capita greenhouse gas emissions, albeit at a slower rate compared to the national average. With a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 2.5%, per capita emissions in the state reached around 1.9 tons of CO2 per capita in 2018. In 2019, Bengal's total greenhouse gas emissions were estimated at approximately 70 million tons.

As the state balances the need for economic growth and development, managing emissions and adopting sustainable practices have become increasingly crucial to mitigate the impacts of climate change and ensure a greener future for its residents. Emissions in the energy sector are distributed across various categories, including Public Electricity Generation, Transportation, Captive Power Plants, Industries, Agriculture, Commercial, and Residential segments, with fugitive emissions originating from fuel production.

Dr. Ashok Kumar, Deputy Director General at the Bureau of Energy Efficiency, Ministry of Power, Government of India, stressed the urgency of taking action against climate change. Drawing from personal experience, he highlighted the devastating effects of climate change in Himachal Pradesh, including torrential rains and floods. Dr. Kumar underscored the importance of initiatives like the Mission LiFE program, initiated by the Prime Minister, as a framework for addressing these challenges and urged the nation to embrace energy efficiency initiatives to protect against climate catastrophes.

At its core, the Decarbonisation India Alliance embodies the imperative to reduce GHG emissions and embraces sustainable development principles. By uniting diverse stakeholders, including industry leaders, manufacturers, and service providers, it promotes a comprehensive approach to decarbonization. Through collaboration and knowledge exchange, the alliance strives to craft innovative solutions and implement industry best practices. This initiative not only targets emissions reduction but also fosters economic expansion and job creation. The shift to a low-carbon economy paves the way for innovation, research, development, and investments in clean technologies and renewable energy infrastructure.

The objectives of DIA encompass expediting the shift to a low-carbon economy, nurturing innovation, facilitating knowledge exchange and capacity-building, and advocating for policies that incentivize decarbonization. R Jayakumar, President of SEEM, emphasized that DIA is a game-changer to accelerate Maharashtra's journey towards net-zero emissions, serving as an all-encompassing framework to coordinate, collaborate, and catalyze efforts in this direction.

G Krishnakumar, National General Secretary at SEEM, provided insights into the SEEM National Action Plan for Decarbonizing India, which spans energy audits, training, collaborative programs, certifications, events, and studies. This comprehensive strategy aims to enhance audit quality, and competency through training, collaborations, expertise recognition, awareness, and data provision for policy-making.

Vinuta Gopal, Chief Executive Officer of Asar, emphasized the pivotal role of industries, energy-saving product manufacturers, and service providers in India's decarbonization journey. She highlighted their contributions in championing renewable energy adoption, enhancing energy efficiency, and advocating green technologies, asserting that the alliance is an essential tool to combat climate change.

The climate crisis demands science-backed emissions reduction targets to limit global warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius, aligning with India's commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070. Achieving this ambitious goal requires a comprehensive decarbonization strategy that harmonizes climate action with resilience-building measures across society, the economy, and the environment. The Decarbonisation India Alliance is poised to play a pivotal role in this critical endeavour.",2023-09-22T13:33:20Z
The Times of India,CWS to get $1m for 'wild carbon' programme | Nagpur News - Times of India,Vijay Pinjarkar,"Nagpur: The Centre for Wildlife Studies (CWS), Karnataka, has been chosen as the first Asian partner for Amazon's Right Now Climate Fund (RNCF) to support communities and wildlife conservation. CWS will get allocation of $1 million to enhance its 'wild carbon' programme.

Amazon's RNCF has launched a $15 million fund for biodiversity and climate resilience projects in the Asia-Pacific region. The CWS will be its first partner to support the wild carbon programme which will enhance wildlife conservation and livelihoods and support climate change mitigation in the Western Ghats.

Amazon on Monday announced a $15 million allocation for nature-based solutions in the Asia-Pacific region. This allocation draws from Amazon's $100 million RNCF, which was created in 2019 to support nature conservation and restoration projects that enhance climate resilience and biodiversity while driving social and environmental benefits in communities where they operate.

""The Asia-Pacific region is home to vast forests and rich coastal environments, but it is also highly vulnerable to climate change, biodiversity loss, and land degradation,"" said Kara Hurst, Amazon's Global VP for Sustainability.

""To protect the region from the impacts of climate change and preserve biodiversity, we will need both large-scale and local action - and we're committed to investing in both.""

The first $3 million from the fund's Asia-Pacific allocation will support nature-based projects in India. For its first project, Amazon will be working with the CWS to support communities and conservation efforts in the Western Ghats, a UNESCO World Heritage Site which is home to more than 30% of all of India's wildlife species, including the world's largest population of wild Asiatic elephants and tigers.

The funding will help CWS establish the 'wild carbon' programme, which will support 10,000 farmers in planting and maintaining one million native trees. The contribution will enable CWS to partner with 2,000 family farms and plant 3 lakh trees over three years.

The trees will help to expand land area for animals and reduce human-wildlife conflict through the creation of natural buffer zones, while also bringing in higher-value trees for the farmers compared to other subsistence crops.

CWS will also use project funds to develop state-of-the-art monitoring systems using drone and remote sensing technology and on-the-ground surveys to verify programme outcomes, advancing research on the potential positive impact of farmers on reforestation opportunities.

""We have designed the 'wild carbon' programme with an unwavering commitment to wildlife conservation, and also poverty alleviation through livelihood support. By partnering with and incentivizing farmers to be part of the solution, we will be able to facilitate buffer habitats for tigers, elephants, and other endangered species,"" said CWS executive director Krithi Karanth.

""Amazon's support enables us to plan and build a programme that is self-sustaining in the long term. The farmers will receive upfront support to select tree types that serve both their livelihoods and the wildlife, whilst also receiving technical assistance, agroforestry training, and support for replanting failed saplings,"" she said.

Projects are selected based on their potential positive impact on local communities and livelihoods, as well as the magnitude and tangibility of benefit to the environment. Further investments in projects located in India and other Asia-Pacific countries will be announced in the coming months.

In 2019, Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge, committing to reach net-zero carbon by 2040 - 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement. The pledge now has more than 400 signatories across 55 industries and 38 countries, which work together on initiatives that preserve the natural world and enable decarbonizing technologies.",2023-09-04T23:22:23Z
Hindustan Times,Mumbai's greenhouse gas emissions to rise 2.7 times by 2050 without intervention: MCAP,,"Mumbai: Mumbai Climate Action Plan (MCAP), released by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday, concluded that Mumbai's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are expected to reach 64.8 million tonnes CO2e/year by 2050, increasing 2.7 times between 2019 and 2050, in a business as usual (BAU) scenario, meaning if no mitigation interventions are undertaken. The projection is slightly higher than the Indian level BAU trajectory, which estimates the surge at 2.5 times. In 2019, Mumbai's GHG emissions were 23.42 million tonnes CO2e, at 1.8 times CO2e per person.

In another scenario - the Existing and Planned (E&P) scenario - which takes into consideration the present policies to reduce emissions, at the city, regional and national level, emissions are expected to reach 51.3 million tons CO2e/year by 2050. This is an increase of 119.4 percent in comparison to base year (2019) emissions, and are not aligned with the 1.5°C Paris Agreement and deadline 2020 emission trajectories.

To address this, MCAP lists an aggressive mitigation strategy, a third scenario. These emission reduction targets aim to reach net-zero by 2050. Net-zero means being able to balance out the amount of GHGs emitted through sequestration (absorption by forests, mangroves, and tree cover).

The MCAP aims 30 percent emissions reduction by 2030, and 44 percent by 2040, against the base year through 'ambitious yet achievable' measures.

According to the GHG inventory for Mumbai as part of MCAP, in 2019 the stationary energy sector is responsible for 16.9 million tonnes CO2e, or 72 per cent of Mumbai's total emissions. The Transportation sector is responsible for 4.56 million tonnes CO2e or 20 percent of the city's total emission; and the Waste sector for 1.94 million tonnes CO2e - 8 percent of Mumbai's total emissions.

Strategies have been identified across six key sectors of urban flooding and water resource management, urban greening and biodiversity, air quality, sustainable mobility, sustainable waste management, and interventions in energy and buildings, with 24 action tracks across these sectors to achieve net-zero.

Experts believe that there is a need to ensure maximum citizens' participation in the implementation of these strategies, and for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to examine all its existing practices, projects and methods.

Rohit Shinkre, senior urban planner and architect, said, ""The approach toward achieving net-zero has to move from governance centric to citizens' centric. This is no longer a governance issue alone, it is an ethical one. After all, it is not only the government that causes global warming, it is the actions of citizens. It is important to tell individuals, families and societies what they can do, so as not to remain passive spectators to the whole process. The civic body must also review every project, method and practice in this context henceforth.""

MCAP includes targets such as 100 percent zero-emission vehicles by 2050 with increased access to finance, policy enablers and incentives; 100 percent electrification of 2 wheelers, taxis, autorickshaws by 2050 and 96 percent electrification of private 4 wheelers by 2050, among others as part of sustainable mobility.

Decentralized waste management to ensure 80 percent recovery through segregation, recycling and composting, and 100 percent scientific disposal of future waste by 2030 as part of sustainable waste management; increasing vegetation cover and permeable surface to 30-40 percent of the city surface area by 2030 among others as part of urban greening; building flood resilient systems and infrastructure and ensuring up to 50 percent of the city's water demand is met through localized water conservation and efficient use initiatives by 2030, as part of urban flooding and water resource management.

A climate action cell will be set up under BMC, which will be responsible for implementing the MCAP; undertake MCAP revision every five years, and every two years - update greenhouse gas emissions inventory and climate and air pollution risks and vulnerability assessment.",2022-03-14T18:37:00Z
The Times of India,Calicut University researcher thrilled as Leonardo DiCaprio uses his Galaxy Frog image in Instagram post about landmark global amphibian study | Kozhikode News - Times of India,Rajeev KR,"KOZHIKODE: It's double honours for Calicut University post-doctoral researcher and Thrissur native Dr. Sandeep Das. Das, a postdoctoral fellow at the CU Zoology department, has been part of a 123-member team of scientists from across the world who had conducted the landmark Global Amphibian Assessment 2 (GAA2) study which was been published in science journal Nature on Wednesday.

And as cherry on top, actor and environment activist Leonardo DiCaprio has used the photograph of the Galaxy Frog (Orange Black Tubercled Indian Microhylid) shot by Das from Thekkady on the actor's Instagram post on the new paper published in Nature which says that climate change has become the main driver of amphibian declines globally.

Das said that the second Global Amphibian Assessment (GAA2) which was completed in June 2022 has found that the status of amphibians worldwide continues to deteriorate with 40.7% (2,873) being globally threatened, compared with 37.9% (2,681) in 1980 and 39.4% (2,788) in 2004 when the GAA1 was held.

More importantly the study found that the climate change effects are the most common primary driver of status deteriorations during 2004-2022, with 119 species (39%) affected compared with 6 species (1%) during 1980-2004

Das said he was very happy that a global celebrity like DiCaprio has posted the photograph of a threatened frog he shot at Thekkady in Kerala in the Instagram post about the study as it would help draw attention to the threats and conservation of amphibians which remain the most threatened vertebrate class.

""Here we are talking about amphibians and not about charismatic mammals like tigers and or elephants which do not need any introduction for people. But as far as frogs are concerned, people would have ever since their childhood approached the animal with a bit of revulsion or dislike. So it is a herculean task for researchers to take the message about the importance of the species and its conservation to the people, to the policy framework and protected area management. So, when an international celebrity like DiCaprio shares it over social media, the message would get tremendous reach and which will help in furthering the cause,"" he said.

Das said that on a personal level he was very happy as the photograph of the Galaxy Frog which he took was shared by the celebrity actor after giving photo credits to him.

Apart from Das, globally renowned amphibian biologist SD Biju was part of the GAA2 study from the state.

The study says that though most category changes since 1980 are deteriorations (788), 120 species have shown improvements in status, moving to less-threatened Red List categories and conservation actions are responsible for 63 of these improvements, 94% of which are results from effective habitat protection and improved habitat management in regions such as the Western Ghats in India, Costa Rica and Sabah in Malaysia.

However, according to the study, Western Ghats feature in the list of locations where the greatest concentrations of threatened species are found along with Caribbean islands, Mesoamerica, the Tropical Andes, the mountains and forests of western Cameroon and eastern Nigeria, Madagascar and Sri Lanka.

""The improvement in the status of species in the Western Ghats is a silver lining and is due to the protected area network covering those areas,"" Das said.",2023-10-07T13:27:44Z

The exhibits are mostly presented as a series, where the first one is lively and full of life while the subsequent ones grow bare and bleached.

A specialty is that the art pieces are made almost entirely of discarded materials, mostly scrap cloth from tailoring shops. ""I make yarn from any material including newspapers, magazines and even used tea bags. We cut them to pieces to create linear material that we either crochet or weave or knit,"" says lead artist Kalyani Pramod, who calls herself a fibre artist.

In the series on bleached corals, plastic has been used to indicate plastic pollution. ""Visitors express their fears of how close to home the effects of climate change are, especially the children. They asked very pertinent questions,"" says the artist.

The exhibition, on at the Alliance Francaise, ends on September 21.

At DakshinaChitra, the art exhibition is called Bhin Bhini: Changing Climate, Uncertain Livelihoods. It is named after a particular pest that preys on crops in Madhya Pradesh. ""These pests are a result of climate change. They arrive in large numbers, denoting multiple perspectives,"" says the curator, Krishna Priya C P. ""DakshinaChitra hosts different kinds of audiences including school children and tourists. We want to make sure we have something for everyone - a story, an experience, something new.""

The Times of India,Greens at biodiversity meet hold politicians responsible for destruction of environment | Goa News - Times of India,Sep,"Margao: The Goa State Biodiversity Board (GSBB) organised an event for biodiversity management committees (BMC) as a part of its participatory approach to combat climate change in Goa. What, however, the officials of the GSBB did not anticipate was the level of antagonism towards the state's politicians for their acts of omission and commission that came to be expressed during the presentations.

Participants of the programme consisting mostly of members of BMCs from across South Goa questioned the role of GSBB in reining in the politicians whom they held responsible for wanton acts of environmental destruction.

""Our governments, both at the Centre and the state, have filed affidavits in courts that run contrary to the facts produced by you in your presentation (to defend their acts potentially harmful to the environment). I can produce evidence of environmental impact assessment (EIA) reports having been manipulated. Have you given this lecture to the government of Goa or the politicians? That's where you should start from,"" said Rupesh Shinkre.

As environmental activists joined in to castigate politicians and allege nexus between them and government officials in committing crimes against the environment, it was left to member secretary, GSBB, Pradip Sarmukadam to calm the frayed nerves.

Sarmukadam explained that the state action plan on climate change was the policy document, the first ever made for Goa, based upon which all programmes and schemes of the government will be devised.

""It takes time to convince the political class,"" Sarmukadam said. ""It is not that if one particular politician doesn't understand, the next one will, almost all politicians are the same.""

He exhorted the gathering to own responsibility for ""correcting"" the situation on climate change by behavioural change. ""And the first step towards that is to know what is scientifically understood as correct,"" he said. ""While we know that everything is not well, that should not stop us from making efforts to make this a better place to live on.""

The Times of India,Global Biofuels Alliance may be a key G20 takeaway under India's presidency - Times of India,Sanjay Dutta,"NEW DELHI: Global Biofuels Alliance (GBA) to speed up development of a multi-system low-carbon energy pathway could be one of the key takeaways from the weekend summit of G20 leaders under India's presidentship of the grouping.

It will reinforce India's position in the fight against climate change and mark a second India-led idea of a multilateral platform for faster transition coming to fruition.

The International Solar Alliance, jointly launched in 2015 by prime minister Naredra Modi and his French counterpart Francois Hollande at the Paris COP21 was the first such idea that had catapulted India at the centre stage of climate action.

On Wednesday, the Cabinet put its stamp on the GBA, comforted by the fact that 19 countries had agreed to stand with India as initiating members of GBA at the G20 14th energy transition ministerial meeting in Goa in July.

The US support was articulated by energy secretary Jennifer Granholm, who, an oil ministry statement had then said, ""recognised"" the establishment of the alliance as a critical step in their biofuels journey with the aim of moving from ""test tube to test drive and field to fuels"".

As Italy, Kenya, UAE and Brazil -- the next G20 President and the world's second-largest biofuel producer -- underlined the need for sharing best practices across policy, technology and implementation, the realisation dawned on the Goa forum that GBA will be useful in providing a collaborative approach needed to deal with challenges regarding feedstock management, developing standards and technological innovations.

Biofuels are derived from a variety of biomass and considered a low-carbon, affordable and sustainable source of energy. In India, the Modi government is pushing biofuels such as ethanol blending of petrol and compressed biogas (CBG) to reduce the economy's carbon footprint, dependence on imported oil and raise income of farmers.

India achieved 10% ethanol blending of petrol in June last year and has a target of 25% blending by 2025.

The Times of India,"TCS employees volunteer 2.2 million hours in FY23, set new record - Times of India",Bella Jaisinghani,"MUMBAI: The employees of Tata Consultancy Service (TCS) worldwide have reportedly volunteered 2.2 million hours in FY23 under the company's volunteering programme HOPE (Hours of Purpose by Employees). Owing to their contribution, TCS has ""achieved the status of the world's number one company for volunteers, with the highest recorded number of volunteer hours"", the company claimed.

As a part of the HOPE initiative, TCS launched #millionhoursofpurpose as a collective effort by its employees to volunteer 1 million hours every quarter. Staffers ""accepted the challenge"" and exceeded the target by a significant margin, contributing over 2 million hours in Q4 alone, thus creating a new record.

The palette of projects that 'TCSers' felt passionately about were climate action (tree plantation, energy conservation, protecting biodiversity, cleanup drives), health promotion (mental health awareness, blood donation, road safety drives), poverty alleviation (donating food, clothes, books, toys) and skill-based volunteering (adult literacy, skilling and mentoring for youth employment). The company claims these impacted the lives of 1.25 million people worldwide.

Balaji Ganapathy, Chief Social Responsibility Officer, TCS, explains the genesis of the HOPE programme and shares inspirational stories of its success.

He says, ""Our aim is to empower people and communities through opportunities in the digital economy. Hours of Purpose by Employees (HOPE) draws on the employee's desire to solve societal problems. While volunteerism has been part of our DNA for over 50 years, we designed HOPE for the post-pandemic workplace.""

""After taking inputs from employee volunteers, leaders and purpose council members, we identified projects like food insecurity, climate change, poverty, mental health, education and literacy, aligned to each of the 17 U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),"" he says.

TCS launched HOPE in Q4, starting with a #millionhoursofpurpose pledge for employees to volunteer 1 million hours by March 31, 2023. The achievement exceeded the goal.

Balaji says, ""We received an overwhelming response from all seniority levels, every location, business unit and demographic group.""

Among the exemplary feats is one by Harini Rayasam, analyst with BTG-Bangalore, whose unit came together to plant nearly 10,000 saplings in and around Bellary, Karnataka. This region faces an acute scarcity of water, is drought prone, and temperatures surpass 40 deg C due to too many industries around the city. A lack of green cover adds to its woes. This team conducted more than 150 plantation drives. Harini says, ""A person who plants trees plants hope. This is our small contribution towards tackling climate change. The joy of giving back to nature has brought a sense of satisfaction to everyone involved.""

Saiket Saha, a solution architect, has been an active contributor to TCS's literacy initiative for adult learners. This time he spearheaded an initiative to donate towards the education of underprivileged children. His team collected books, writing and drawing kits, sports equipment, health drinks, food items and clothes. They actually made environment-friendly paper bags using old newspapers and ropes for distributing the items. ""The best part was when we went to an NGO and distributed the goodies to the children. We are hopeful that our contribution will help them continue their education,"" says Saiket.

Ravi Varma, an associate systems engineer trainee with EGG-Lucknow, was a first-time volunteer. Merely 90 minutes of the task have made him want to continue. He says, ""The activity I chose was to educate a group of young girls about phishing and cyber attacks. I had some free time. When I reached the classroom I saw their keenness to learn. The next 90 minutes were a life-changing experience for me, and I gave it my 100%.""

Balaji says, ""We are born with equal potential but not equal opportunity. In today's digital economy, access to opportunity can ensure we build equitable and inclusive pathways for women, youth and marginalised groups.""

From literacy to livelihood, quality education, skilling, employment, and digital entrepreneurship to addressing the last mile needs of rural India, TCS empowers marginalised communities through programmes such as Literacy as a Service, goIT, Ignite My Future, Youth Employment Program and BridgeIT. These programmes encompass India and 43 countries around the world.

Balaji says, ""In FY23, for example, we reached 4.5 million people, empowering 1.1 million women, 5,81,000 youth, and 1.3 million marginalised people. We recognise that no one company can solve societal problems. By associating with the government, private sector, NGOs, academia and policymakers, we work in communities, drive advocacy efforts and contribute to national and local policy to engineer social impact.""",2023-06-18T02:42:00Z

The Times of India," Sea levels rising faster, Indian cities at high flood risk: IPCC | India News - Times of India",,"NEW DELHI: Four Indian coastal cities -- Kolkata, Mumbai, Surat and Chennai -- will be severely threatened due to sea level rise while several others in the north India will be exposed to acute water crisis due to melting of Himalayan glaciers by the end of the century, a UN body on climate change hinted on Wednesday.

Sea levels, rising faster than ever before, are on course to rise one metre higher due to melting of ice in the business-as-usual scenario by 2100, severely affecting over 1.4 billion people globally, a special report on ""oceans and cryosphere"" released by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warned on Wednesday.

Four Indian cities are among 45 such coastal port cities globally where even an increase of sea level by 50cm will lead to flooding. In fact, the extreme sea level events that used to happen once a century in the past will occur every year by mid-century in many regions, increasing risks for many low-lying coastal cities and small islands.

Sounding another alarm for urgent action to slow down the pace of global warming, a new IPCC report released in Monaco on Wednesday said increasing warming of the oceans and accelerated sea level rise would lead to widespread death of marine life leading to a seafood crisis and increasingly destructive cyclones.

Marine heatwaves have likely doubled in frequency between 1982 and 2016, the report said, warning that the pace of change was accelerating.

The IPCC report, which referenced nearly 7,000 research papers, warns that sea levels are rising faster than previously thought due to accelerating rates of ice melt. It said that sea levels would rise globally by around 30-60cm by the end of this century even if emissions of GHG are sharply reduced and global warming is limited to well below 2 degree Celsius.

But, oceans will rise by around 60-110cm if humans continue to emit increasing amounts of GHGs -- in a scenario where the collective mitigation targets of all countries under the Paris Agreement would lead to global average temperature rise of over 3 degree Celsius by 2100.

The report showed that the seas have actually risen globally by around 15cm during the 20th century while ""it is currently rising more than twice as fast -- 3.6mm per year -- and accelerating"".

Though the IPCC doesn't release city or country-specific data in these special reports, the published scientific researches cited by it while preparing the report have some indications for Asia and south Asia region.

On key takeaways for India, IPCC report co-author Anjal Prakash noted that around 240 million people of the entire Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) regions -- an covering all the high mountain chains of central, south and inner Asia -- would be affected due to changes in the cryosphere as it may affect the ""world's largest renewable supplies of fresh water"".

Referring to rising temperature and very high global warming scenario (3.5-6 degree Celsius) by 2100, Prakash said, ""This will lead to significant losses in glacier volume, from 36% to 64%, depending on the warming scenario, and impact timing of water flows and water availability (in the HKH regions). So, the rate of risk is extremely high in the present emission scenario"".

But amid all these alarms there is a silver lining, provided nations scale up their collective mitigation targets and work for adaptation. ""If we reduce emissions sharply, the consequences for people and their livelihoods will still be challenging, but potentially more manageable for those who are most vulnerable,"" said Hoesung Lee, chair of the IPCC, underlining the importance of building resilience as part of adaptation exercises.

Adaptation has to be part of the solution, Prakash added. ""The mantra for solution is to adapt, adapt and adapt. There are many ways in which it could be done through policy changes and planning and to create climate resilient infrastructure"".",2019-09-25T22:21:00Z
The Times of India,"Govt to focus on reducing water, power use by half in 20 years - Times of India",,"New Delhi, Oct 3 () Reducing water and power use by half and promoting renewable energy and public transport are ""key elements"" of the government's urban development strategy for the next 20 years, according to a report released today.

Housing and Urban Poverty Alleviation Minister M Venkaiah Naidu released the India Habitat III-National Report on World Habitat Day today, ahead of the UN Habitat III Conference in Quito, Ecuador later this month where a global new urban agenda for the next 20 years is going to be adopted.

India's strategy for urban development intends to give a big push to use growing urbanisation for rapid economic development while at the same time committing itself to address issues of sustainable development and climate change, Naidu said.

""The challenge is about ensuring sustainable development while taking advantage of economic growth that results from rapid urbanisation in the country. For long, urbanisation has been looked at from the limited perspective of providing basic services... We need to go for a big push to harness fully the potential of urbanisation,"" he said.

Stating that cities need to be made efficient, productive, inclusive, safe and sustainable, he said the agenda for the next two decades proposed in the national report will be ensuring economic growth and productivity, improving quality of life, addressing issues of inclusivity, sustainability and climate change.

The minister said the outcomes of new urban agenda based on sustainable urban planning would include reducing water and electricity use by 50 per cent from that of normal use, enabling over 60 per cent of urban travel by public transport, generating half of power from renewable sources, and promoting walking and cycling for last mile connectivity.

Promoting natural drainage patterns, reducing waste generation of all kind and promoting greenery are some of the government agenda for sustainable urban development, he said.

On India ratifying the Paris Agreement on Climate Change yesterday, Naidu said, ""It is an eloquent testimony of India's commitment to sustainable development.""

Referring to the theme of this year's Word Habitat Day of 'Housing at Centre', Naidu said that under Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) launched in June last year, construction of over 10 lakh houses for urban poor has been approved which is close to the number of houses approved during the nine years of JNNURM during the previous regime.

The Times of India,India to seek equitable agreement on phasing out of HFCs: Dave - Times of India,,"New Delhi, Sep 27 () India will seek an ""equitable"" agreement that is in the best interest of the nation at the forthcoming negotiations on phasing down of harmful greenhouse gas hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) scheduled to take place in Rwanda later this year.

Environment Minister Anil Madhav Dave stressed the need for focussing on issues like energy efficiency through research and development and changing architecture and consumption patterns to reduce cooling needs.

""India remains committed to address the issue of climate change. India would seek an equitable agreement in Kigali that is in the best interests of the nation, its people, as well as the larger global community,"" Dave said.

He was speaking at the roundtable where stakeholders across industry groups and international experts discussed the challenges faced by India in phasing down high global warming potential (GWP) HFCs.

The 28th Meeting of the Parties (MOP 28) to the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the Ozone Layer is scheduled to consider, among other things, negotiations on a HFC amendment.

""The need is to focus on issues like energy efficiency, using CSR for research and development, and on demand-side management - changing architecture and consumption patterns to reduce cooling needs,"" Dave said.

The minister said India leads by example through its sustainable lifestyle habits which are key to mitigating climate change issues.

A key concern that came up during the discussions was the additional cost involved in migrating to greener technologies, an official statement said.

According to a recent research, the economy wide cost for transition for India between 2015 and 2050 would be 12 billion Euros for the Indian proposal and 34 billion Euros for the North American proposal.

""There are different estimates as to what it will cost to make the switch. But we must emphasise in Kigali that the commitment of donor countries has to be absolute and this assurance is necessary to fulfil any commitment India makes. ""One thing is clear. The debate is not on what needs to be done, but on how to do it. We have to make sure all parties are comfortable.

New Delhi, Mar 29 () A group of lawmakers has asked the government to make some crucial policy changes in existing schemes to facilitate low carbon development work in their constituencies and said India's ambitious target of low carbon emissions can be met by local area actions by MPs.

MPs and MLAs under the Climate Parliament network urged the Centre to make changes in MPLAD and Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana to facilitate low carbon development works in their constituencies.

They also demanded establishment of ""Legislator Support Cell"" within the Environment New and Renewable Energy Ministry for continued support to legislators in this sphere.

Climate Parliament is an international cross-party network of legislators dedicated to preventing climate change and promoting renewable energy and supports lawmakers to undertake initiatives at national and regional levels to help accelerate the global renewable switch.

Karanataka MP Prahlad Joshi and MLA Arvind Bellad and Odisha MP Kalikesh Singh Deo, on behalf of the Climate Parliament, have also written a letter to Ministers of Power, Coal and Renewable Energy and Rural Development as well as to the Speaker and Chairman of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha regarding the issue.

""India's ambitious targets at the COP21 Paris Agreement can be met by local area actions by the MPs and MLAs. The MPs and MLA have asked the government to make some important policy changes in the existing government schemes,"" they said.

They also demanded establishment of a ""Legislator Support Cell"" within the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy or the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change for continued support to legislators in this sphere, a Climate Parliament statement said.

""The letter also suggests that financing, lack of adequate information, capacity and training locally as well as certain administrative barriers are some of the major issues affecting the low carbon development works,"" the statement said.

The Times of India,'COP28 to help build the foundation for the climate finance system of the future' - Times of India,Vishwa Mohan,"NEW DELHI: Ahead of the upcoming 28th session of the UN climate change conference (COP28) in Dubai, its president-designate, Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, has written to 198 nations, including India, assuring that the UAE presidency for the annual meet would work for making it a ""milestone"" to help build the foundation for the climate finance system of the future.

In his letter, he also reminded the rich nations of their unfulfilled promises on delivering climate finance for supporting developing countries, and urged them to scale up finance saying the current level of replenishment is ""neither ambitious nor adequate"" to meet the world's challenge.

""Developed nations must honour their commitments and provide maximal assurances to channel $100 billion annually towards developing countries through to 2025, as well as show progress on at least doubling adaptation finance by 2025,"" said Al Jaber who is also the UAE special envoy for climate change.

He said, ""As I laid out before, COP28 should be a milestone to help build the foundation for the finance system of the future...We intend to build on this collective progress and ensure that COP28 becomes a defining milestone for Parties (countries) to accelerate action and deliver real results.""

The agenda of COP28, which is to be held during November 30 - December 12, will focus on fast-tracking just, equitable and orderly energy transition and slashing emissions before 2030; transforming climate finance by delivering on old promises and setting the framework for a new deal on finance; putting nature, people, lives and livelihoods at the heart of climate action; and mobilising for an inclusive COP.

Sharing the broad agenda, Al Jaber invited all countries to join COP28's pledge endorsing the tripling of global renewables capacity (reaching 11 TW by 2030) and doubling of the annual average global rate of energy efficiency improvements between now and 2030 (reaching 4%), and to come to COP with tangible commitments to realise this goal.

The upcoming COP would also be significant as the countries would conclude the first ever global stocktake of their climate action spelling out the gaps in actions, and finalise the mechanism for 'loss and damage' finance and its donor base.

The president-designate also emphasised on the need to ensure the new fund for addressing 'loss and damage' at the earliest. ""We cannot delay this by having a multi-year process to agree on governance,"" said Al Jaber.",2023-10-18T17:32:54Z
The Times of India,Damselfly that can highlight climate distress | Nagpur News - Times of India,Vijay Pinjarkar,"Nagpur: By naming a newly discovered species of damselfly as 'Armageddon Reedtail' (Protosticta Armageddonia), the scientific community is trying to draw the world's attention to the looming ecological crisis mankind faces in view of rampant habitat loss and climate change.

The revelation of this newfound species by experts from MIT-World Peace University (MIT-WPU) in Pune has been officially documented in the esteemed International Journal of Odonatology, a publication affiliated with the Worldwide Dragonfly Association (WDA) based in the United States.

The discovery -- made in Southwestern Ghats of Kerala -- has been recorded and registered with the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI), Pune, underscoring its significance in the scientific community.

Pankaj Koparde, assistant professor with the department of environmental studies at MIT-WPU is the lead researcher. ""The naming of this new species is not merely an academic exercise; it is a desperate plea for attention. Just as this species faces the threat of extinction due to habitat loss and changing environmental conditions, countless other endemic and endangered insects are on the brink of vanishing forever,"" Koparde told TOI.

Experts are using the new species, with its ominous moniker, as a powerful call to action for world leaders, urging them to address the urgent issues of climate change and their catastrophic impact on biodiversity.

Koparde said the world needs a collaborative effort involving scientists, conservationists, policymakers and the public to combat climate change and protect our planet's biodiversity.

The name 'Armageddon Reedtail' is a direct reference to the concept of 'Ecological Armageddon', a term used to describe the devastating decline of insect populations around the world.

The research team comprised Pankaj Koparde, assistant professor with department of environmental studies at MIT-WPU, Arajush Payra, a doctoral scholar, Ameya Deshpande, a student and Reji Chandran, a wildlife photographer from Kerala.

Chandran, who first spotted the species in Southwestern Ghats of Kerala, says, ""I have seen the forests of the Western Ghats change rapidly due to rampant development and habitat loss. The discovery of Armageddon Reedtail serves as a symbolic representation of the broader crisis we are facing and we need to do something about it before it's too late.""

Arajush Payra, an entomologist and the lead author, said the new species is different from its congeners based on various morphological features. ""Keying it out was a difficult task but we now have clarity about its taxonomy. I believe that our discovery will be a milestone in Indian odonatology,"" Payra said.",2023-09-24T22:50:27Z

This collaboration, which was started during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's official visit to the White House earlier this year, aims to deploy 10,000 electric buses manufactured in India across various cities in the country.

The joint effort represents a crucial step towards addressing the climate crisis, with both nations demonstrating their commitment to sustainable and eco-friendly solutions.

""We know that electric buses can change the world. They are quieter and cleaner. They help us reduce our carbon and give us a future where our planet will be livable. It is one of the reasons, the US Govt is working together with our friends in the Govt of India to get more electric buses on the streets of Indian cities quicker. We have launched an initiative to help 10,000 electric buses be on Indian streets...,"" said Garcetti while talking to ANI.

Today the United States and India launched a mechanism that will facilitate deployment of 10,000 made-in-India electric buses in cities across the country, bringing into reality a joint vision first announced during Prime Minister Modi's official state visit to the White House. The United States is proud to partner with India as it shows the change that can be achieved through focused and cooperative action, according to a US Embassy press release.

Garcetti added, ""Every day we see the impact of the climate crisis at a global level. We must respond now or jeopardize the future of our planet and our people. The partnership announced today will mobilize financing for a fleet of 10,000 electric buses throughout India, expanding options for electric public transportation in India, creating cleaner cities and healthier communities.""

The recent G20 Leaders' Summit underscored that the United States and India are partnering to tackle the climate crisis through sustainable investments, including decarbonisation of the public transportation sector, the release said.

This new initiative between the governments of India and the United States shows how public and private partners can work together to lower emissions and promote electric mobility. Through this new partnership, the US government, including the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and the office of the US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, will partner with public and private-sector entities to accelerate electric bus financing. Partners including India's Ministry of Heavy Industries, and Convergence Energy Services Limited, will collaborate with private philanthropies such as the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet and the Sequoia Foundation, according to the release.

A key component of this project will be a new payment security mechanism (PSM) that will accelerate new and more sustainable investments by lowering financial risks. By mitigating risk for lenders, the PSM leads to improved loan terms and reduced financing costs, facilitating smoother project implementation. Ultimately, this partnership sets a new model for international cooperation in the field of electric mobility, the release said.",2023-09-21T06:17:33Z

The Times of India,"Mission Millet good, but crop diversity need of the hour, says seed researcher Sanjay Patil | Nagpur News - Times of India","TNN, Oct","Nagpur: Year 2023 has been declared International Year of Millets. Not just quantity, but food quality is also assuming importance. Unchecked use of chemical inputs along with excess reliance on hybrid and genetically modified (GM) seeds have raised farmers' expenses, while profit remains low or uncertain. Above all, climate change is affecting cropping patterns and outputs.

In these circumstances, the role of people like Sanjay Patil becomes crucial because of his penchant for finding traditional and local seed varieties and propagating them as part of the BAIF Development Research Foundation, Pune's climate smart agriculture initiatives. Patil discovered over 800 varieties across seven states, including Maharashtra in last three decades. He has travelled extensively and coordinated with thousands of farmers to find traditional and local varieties of maize, paddy, pulses, vegetables, and several millets like ragi, kodo. Patil spoke to TOI in the backdrop of 'Beejotsav' held in Warora recently on challenges that besiege farmers and what needs to be done to make India's millet mission a success.

Excerpts from an interview

Q. What is the importance of reviving and conserving traditional seeds?

A. The Green Revolution in Sixties served its purpose of making the country self-sufficient in food. Now, the challenges are manifold -- climate change, nutrition security, reducing options of livelihood and loss of food diversity. We need crops that can survive drought, flood and can give more yield in a short duration without compromising on nutrition value. Today, many people are taking ill due to deficiency in calcium, iron and other micro-nutrients. Revival of traditional and native seed varieties is the answer to these challenges. Also, new and better seeds cannot be prepared without its wild cousins. Hence, the need for traditional seeds.

Q. Soyabean crop in Vidarbha has been hit by yellow mosaic virus. Why do you think it happened?

A. Today, we grow not more than 10 to 15 crop types across the country. If a disease or pest hits, the entire crop is lost. In mono cropping, our farmers grow the same hybrid sub-varieties over vast tracts of land. In Vidarbha, majority farmers from a particular village chose to grow soyabean that too of the same hybrid type. So, when the yellow mosaic virus stuck, it wiped out the entire crop. Pesticides don't help in the long run because over the years pests develop resistance. That's why we need crop diversity. Earlier, Vidarbha farmers followed mixed cropping pattern with soyabean, tur, jowar, cotton grown together.

Q. East Vidarbha is primarily a paddy belt. Vagaries of monsoon are hitting farmers hard. What should they do?

A. We need to develop seed varieties that suit different land types. In nature, mutation happens with changing atmospheric conditions. Dadaji Khobragade, a farmer, bred and refined a high-yielding variety of paddy called HMT. The adaptable genotype extracted by Dadaji has been spreading since then. Today, we need farmers to keep looking for natural mutations in different crops and identify adaptable type of mutations and purify them for mass production. This process should continue forever. This will help take the best gene forward. One crop, one variety is not a good idea. Paddy farmers should opt for varieties with varying maturity period like 90 to 110 days, 110 to 130 days and above. Growing this varied mix of seeds together will ensure that if one crop fails others will survive.

Q. Millet movement has begun in India, but what are the challenges ahead?

A. Millets can grow in adverse conditions -- in hills, low rainfall areas and even on poor soil. That's why they are also called climate-resilient crops. Tribals call them God's crop. The best examples of millets found in India are raagi, varai, jowar, bajra, sava, kang, barti, kodo among others. Today, we need millets that can survive high as well as low rainfall. Unfortunately, they have been neglected by researchers. A study is needed to find out diversity in millets. The National Gene Bank, ICRISAAT Hyderabad, Indian Institute of Millets Hyderabad have saved seeds in ex situ form, but we also need varieties peculiar to specific regions in in situ form -- right on the farmer's field. We need diversity in millets. One or two types of raagi (finger millet) cannot be grown in all agroclimatic zones of the country. For eg, raagi grown in Uttarakhand may not be suitable to grow in Vidarbha because of changed climatic conditions, soil type and water availability.

Q. How can diversity be brought in millets?

A. We need to go back to nature. Mutation keeps happening in nature. Identify the right mutations and take them forward. A participatory approach needs to be taken where researchers and farmers work together. Study, propagate and disperse the information among farmers. This should be the way forward. Farmers' age-old wisdom should be respected. Variation in land topography, soil, grain quality, fodder quality are things that need to be taken into consideration mainly to select a seed which provides maximum nutrition with resistance to diseases and pests.

Q. Have millets gained acceptance in urban households?

A. Urban consumers have understood the value of millets in food. Declaring this year as International Millet Year is a big achievement for India. Today, consumer awareness is good, but backend questions are very critical. Climate-resilient and high-yielding varieties are not available. We also need seeds suitable for different agroclimatic zones. The government should start a yield improvement programme using sustainable farming practice. Afterall, we should not end up growing millets at mass levels using harmful pesticides and fertilizers. Choosing seed varieties suitable for local conditions is the most important task.

Most importantly, decentralized millet processing units should be set up along with development of sustainable storage systems because millets cannot be stored for a long duration. Women's self-help groups can play an important role. Also, we should not restrict millet propagation to biscuits and snacks, but make it a part of every mother's household recipes.",2023-10-17T23:36:46Z
Hindustan Times,Centre notifies two green initiatives ahead of COP28,,"New Delhi: Ahead of the UN Climate Summit, or COP 28, set to held in Dubai in November-December this year, the Union government has notified two initiatives -- a green credit programme focusing on afforestation and water conservation and an ecomark scheme to promote ""eco-friendly"" products.

These initiatives will take ahead Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Lifestyle for Environment, or LiFE, movement announced in 2021, the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) said in a statement on Friday.

The two initiatives ""indicate the country's pro-active approach to climate change, sustainability and promotion eco-conscious practices,"" the ministry said. ""These initiatives, the Green Credit Program (GCP) and the Ecomark Scheme, seek to encourage environmentally friendly practices rooted in tradition and conservation; reflecting the ideas of LiFE concept.""

The GCP is a market-based mechanism designed to incentivise voluntary environmental actions across diverse sectors, by individuals, communities, private sector industries, and companies. Its governance framework is supported by an inter-ministerial steering committee and the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE) will monitor the overall implementation, the ministry said.

""In its initial phase, GCP will focus on water conservation and afforestation,"" it said, adding the Green Credit Registry and trading platform is being developed by ICFRE to facilitate the registration and the buying and selling of green credits.

The ministry has also recast its ecomark notification so that consumers are able to make choices among products and thereby opt for those products that are eco-friendly in their design and process, the statement said.

""The Ecomark Scheme, notified on October 13, 2023, replaces the previous notification (issued on February 21, 1991). It provides accreditation and labelling for household and consumer products that meet specific environmental criteria while maintaining quality standards as per Indian norms,"" the statement said. ""Products accredited under the Ecomark Scheme will adhere to specific environmental criteria, ensuring minimal environmental impact.""

The GCP notification comes months after the Forest Conservation (Amendment) Act came into effect after it received the President's assent on August 4, days after parliament passed the corresponding amendment bill. The amendment removes ""deemed forests"" from the purview of the law.",2023-10-14T01:32:06Z
The Times of India,3-day exercise on climate disasters from tomorrow - Times of India,"TNN, Updated Oct 8","Panaji: The three-day annual joint humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) exercise -- based on PM Narendra Modi's directive -- will be held in Goa from Monday with eight other countries from the Indian Ocean region participating.

The focus this year is on disasters caused by climate change, and the tri-services along with the Indian Coast Guard, National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), National Institute for Disaster Management (NIDM), and National Remote Sensing Agencies will be participating in the exercise.

The multi-agency exercise will work towards developing coordinated and effective response mechanisms to address humanitarian crises and natural disasters in the country and neighbouring states.

""The challenge posed by climate change is accentuated by the limited capacity of littoral Indian Ocean countries to address this rapidly growing threat. Indian Armed Forces have been frequently called upon to render assistance to our friends and partners in the region,"" said a senior naval officer.

India is positioning itself as the first responder in the Indian Ocean region and hopes that joint HADR exercises will help build a cohesive and quick response to disasters.

""While the three services continue to provide relief and succour in the event of a calamity, a whole-of-government-approach would further enhance our preparedness and response to such unfortunate events,"" said the naval officer.

The joint exercise is conducted by the Indian Army, Indian Navy, and Indian Air Force in rotation, with the last edition of the exercise conducted at Agra by the IAF. This year, the Navy is hosting the exercise at INS Hansa.

""Humanitarian assistance operations form a key component in the Indian Navy's benign role, as climate change has significantly increased vulnerability of the Indian Ocean region (IOR) to natural disasters,"" said the naval officer.

The exercise will see discussions on climate change, risk reduction, disaster response and knowledge sharing by experts from various agencies.

A multi-agency capability demonstration will be conducted on Wednesday, and this will showcase drills on rescue and relief to highlight skills and tactics.",2023-10-07T19:23:18Z
The Times of India,'biodiversity Heritage Tag' Likely For Forests Near Gupteswar | - Times of India,Oct 6,"Koraput: Over 350 hectares of forests adjacent to Gupteswar Temple under Jeypore forest division in Koraput may soon get the 'biodiversity heritage site' tag from the department of forestry, environment and climate change.

Earlier, Mandasaru hills of Kandhamal, Mahendragiri hills of Gajapati and Gandhamardan hills of Balangir and Bargarh districts have earned 'biodiversity heritage site' tag in the state.

Officials said an exhaustive inventory, prepared by the Odisha Biodiversity Board with assistance from MS Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF) in Jeypore, has identified 608 varieties of fauna and at least 704 types of flora within the proposed site. The flora include 92 varieties of medicinal plants, highlighting the site's ecological significance.

""Out of the 608 types of fauna, at least 15 species are classified as 'threatened', with some being endemic to the state. Similarly, at least 16 varieties of flora have been listed in the endangered category, emphasising the imperative for their conservation,"" said Kartik Lenka, a scientist at MSSRF, Jeypore.

The proposed tag carries significant implications for the region's flora and fauna, which faces numerous environmental pressures like climate change, invasive species and natural disaster, among others.

""Climate change is the biggest threat to the biodiversity. Issues like irregular rainfall, high temperature and declining ground water level negatively impacts the region's flora and fauna and agro-diversity. Hence, the area has to be protected,"" said Lenka.

The tag promises long-term protection, conservation and management of species that are classified as endangered and endemic to the region. ""The Gupteswar cave shrine witnesses hundreds of devotees daily and is vital for preserving the region's rich cultural heritage. The proposal has been submitted through the appropriate channels. We are hopeful of Gupteswar getting the biodiversity heritage site tag soon,"" said Subash Chandra Khuntia, assistant conservator of forests, Jeypore forest division.

The Times of India,Mapping Disputes To Seasons Helps Reduce Rural Crimes | - Times of India,Soumitra Bose,"Nagpur: Rural cops have identified over 1,200 locations as 'dispute prone', and started taking preventive actions there on a war-footing at the onset of the kharif season.

Rural SP Harssh A Poddar, an IPS officer of 2013 batch, led the survey by each police station to mark places where earlier disputes have erupted, as a means of curtailing violence from fights surrounding farmlands.

Poddar, a former Fullbright scholar at the Harvard Kennedy school, had penned a paper 'Adapting law enforcement to climate induced conflict' while pursuing his Mason fellowship. The paper underlined that the 'global warming metes out heretofore unforeseen depredations on earth. Agriculture-dependent communities will be adversely affected. This could trigger competing interests, leading to escalation into violent conflicts'.

Due to climate change, unpredictable rain and weather cycle, and crop damage, there has been a sharp rise in violent and unethical agrarian competition, attempts of land grabbing, fence breaking and confrontation leading to crimes like assaults, hurts, rioting, attempt to murder and homicides too in the rural sector. These crimes typically escalate during the sowing and harvesting seasons.

Poddar had successfully implemented a rural policing plan based upon the agrarian calender in Beed district. He had then submitted an international paper on his experiment in the academic journal of 'Fletcher Forum of World Affairs', which is managed by the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.

Poddar told TOI the objective was to ensure strategic police intervention in the dispute-prone areas to avoid major cognizable crimes like hurts, riots, assaults and other serious body offences. ""We have started slapping preventive actions more under section 110 (58 cases) and 107 (245 cases) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) now against persons having violent crime records and randomly issuing warning under 149 (634) CrPc,"" said the SP.

Action under various preventive actions has already been initiated at 434 places and villages while the target is more than 1,200 actions. ""Once the Ganpati festival ends, we will escalate serving warning notices under section 149 of CrPC and randomly under 110 and 107 CrPC too,"" he said.

Poddar said he would repeat the same policing exercise before the rabi season too. ""In Beed, this strategic policing following the climate change pattern helped reduce 42% assualt and such crimes annually,"" he said.

""Dispute mapping has also been made a part of the training module for newly inducted police patils or police wardens,"" said Poddar, adding disciplinary action will also be taken against beat marshals for violence at places having history of old disputes.",2023-09-26T03:06:20Z
The Times of India,Status of Tigers Report: Big cats hit half century in Bihar's Valmiki Tiger Reserve | Patna News - Times of India,Piyush Tripathi,"PATNA: Valmiki Tiger Reserve (VTR) in West Champaran district has hit a half-century in terms of tigers as per the latest Status of Tigers, 2022 report released by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change on Saturday. VTR is Bihar's lone tiger reserve.

As per the comparatives figures given in the report on individual tiger reserves and states, the number of tigers in VTR has been estimated at 54, translating into 75% rise in the number of big cats from the last four-yearly tiger census held in 2018. The number of the felines in VTR has, in fact, surged by seven times over the last 12 years.

""As compared to twofold rise in the countrywide number of tigers in the last decade, VTR numbers have increased approximately seven times during the same period,"" secretary (environment, forest and climate change) Bandana Preyashi told TOI.

She added: ""Compared to an increase of merely three tigers during the previous All India Tiger Estimation (2014-2018) for VTR, the numbers increased by 23 during next estimation (2018-2022). It is highly commendable.""

The number of tigers in VTR increased from a meagre eight in 2010 to 28 in 2014, 31 in 2018 and finally 54 in 2022.

Earlier, the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) rated VTR in ""good"" category in terms of management effectiveness evaluation (MEE) system under 'Status of Tigers-2022' summary report released by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 9. VTR scored 77.97% in the MEE, putting it at 38th position among the 51 tiger reserves assessed in the census.

This was the fifth cycle of the nationwide tiger estimation exercise in India -- 28 tiger reserves were assessed in the first cycle in the year 2006, 39 reserves in 2010, 43 in 2014, 50 in 2018 and 51 tiger reserves in 2022. With the number of big cats surging up to 54, VTR stood at 23rd position among the 51 tiger reserves assessed in the last census (2022).

Among the other accolades, the VTR got a certificate of appreciation under India Biodiversity Awards 2021 in the category of 'Conservation of Wildlife Species'. The VTR has received the prestigious RBS Earth Hero Award-Earth Guardian category in 2017.",2023-07-29T17:41:00Z

Hindustan Times,'Incredible someone could lie like this': Top EU official pans Russia's Lavrov,,"NEW DELHI: The European Union's (EU) foreign and security policy chief Josep Borrell on Friday dismissed Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov's assertion that countries are suffering because of the West's reaction to the Ukraine crisis, saying it's ""incredible that someone could lie...in this manner"". Borrell, who was in New Delhi to attend the G20 foreign ministers' meeting and participate in the Raisina Dialogue, also spoke in an interview about the reasons behind the EU's efforts to forge stronger trade and technology relations with India. Edited excerpts:

You were part of an intense meeting of G20 foreign ministers that ended without consensus on a joint communique. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has blamed the West for the war in Ukraine and said other countries are suffering because of the West's reaction.

Everybody knows it was the European fleet which is blocking the grain from Ukraine, everybody knows that our warships were blocking the grain from Ukraine, no? Who was blocking the grain from Ukraine? The Russian Navy. Who invaded Ukraine? Has Russia been invaded by someone? No. I think this is a complete denial of reality. Lavrov lives in a different world.

Who attacked whom? Who blocked food from Ukraine reaching the African people? Who has created trouble in the world economy?... the story that Russia was defending [against] the West's attacks and the consequences are being produced by European sanctions - that's incredible that someone could lie on this in this manner.

In light of the lack of consensus at the G20 foreign ministers' meeting which was focused on Ukraine, do you worry it could detract from other challenges facing the G20?

This war didn't come from a natural catastrophe, it has been caused by someone deciding to launch the war. So, let's call it the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We know that apart from that, there are many other problems and catastrophes in the world, economic problems, inflation, prices rising for energy and food. The fact that we are engaging on supporting Ukraine doesn't mean we are abandoning or not taking care [of other issues]. We continue doing the same thing that we have done before the war. But it looks like people take it for granted.

What we have done for Ukraine is on the top of not a single euro being diverted from someone else to go to Ukraine. It has been additional spending. We continue being committed to our engagement with everybody around the world and in particular, with our partners and the most vulnerable countries. We are the biggest banner in cooperation around the world. We are the biggest humanitarian aid supporter. We have the biggest funding for climate change.

Foreign minister Lavrov also said one of the reasons Russia didn't sign up for a joint statement was that many things have changed since the G20 Summit in 2022 and the Bali consensus does not reflect today's situation.

Well, things have become much worse. The difference is that the war has been raging and now Russia is destroying Ukraine. The Russian Army has been performing very badly and has been pushed back. Now, since they cannot conquer the territory, they are just destroying it and bombing every day. Maybe Lavrov mentioned that as one of the biggest differences between Bali and now.

India has ambitious proposals within the G20 process for helping the rest of the world, especially the Global South. How do you see the EU working with India to achieve these goals?

India is becoming a key geopolitical player. It's quite evident because of its economic growth, its size as the most populous country, the 5th largest GDP. It is one of the geopolitical actors with which we would like to be a stronger partner. The fact that we are spending a lot of political, financial and military energies on supporting Ukraine doesn't mean that we forget what's happening around the world. We know which are the concerns of India with respect to climate change, digitalisation, growth and poverty. We were good partners of India before the war and we will be still better partners after the war.

India has a very strong strategic partnership and defence and energy links with Russia. Does the EU wish to help India diversify its sources of defence hardware and energy? Can the new India-EU Trade and Technology Council (TTC) help in such efforts?

We want to increase our links with India in technology and trade. But since you mention it, we are not worried at all by the fact that India is buying Russian oil. If they can buy it at a discounted price, better for you. Our purpose is to decrease and diminish Russia's financial capacity, the income they get from selling oil. But we know the oil market has to be balanced and if everybody in the world was not buying Russian oil, we will be in trouble because the market will be very unbalanced. So, it's not a problem for us and good for India if they can buy Russian oil at a better price.

But would you work to increase trade and technology links, maybe in terms of defence and new critical technologies through the TTC?

This is our will and the purpose of the TTC. We want to be a better partner for India and it's in our interest. It's not a matter of solidarity, it's a matter of self-interest. We want to engage with an emerging power like India, understanding very well the world in which we are going to live is already a multipolar world, that India will be one of the poles of this multipolarity. We Europeans want to be a pole and if we want the world to be not only multipolar but multilateral, it means having the poles in good touch with each other to together build peace and prosperity.

The European pole has to have better relations, economically, technologically, politically, with the Indian pole because India is building geopolitical capacity. Now that there is this duality between the West and Russia created by Russia's aggression against Ukraine, we have to make everybody aware this war is not the war between Russia and the West, it's not Russia defending against an attack that never happened. It is about the UN Charter, the rules that govern our peaceful coexistence. This is the core of the problem, and we call on everybody to make it clear to Russia that they are not supporting this act of aggression.

On the India-EU negotiations for agreements on free trade, investments and geographical indications, what has happened so far and do you have a timeline for concluding the talks?

I don't think anyone has [a timeline]. I've been talking with my friend, the foreign minister of India. I know both parties are interested in this. On the new geopolitical landscape and this new multipolarity, these trade relationships will have to be developed while looking for complementarities and trying to avoid excessive dependencies. Because the global market has shown trade is good, when it improves the economic performance, it's a win-win situation.

But we have to avoid dependency like the one that we had with Russia. One of the most remarkable things of this war is that we have been cancelling our strong energy dependency. Forty per cent of our gas was coming from Russia before the war and now it's almost zero. I can say the same thing about coal and oil. We have to take care of complementarity in energy and digitalisation, which will be the privileged fields of cooperation that allow both of us to take advantage of our relationship without falling into dependencies that we have learned can be damaging.

An area of focus for both India and Europe is the Indo-Pacific. India also looks at the Indo-Pacific in terms of the challenges from China. How can India and the EU cooperate in this area and can the EU do anything to help India address these challenges?

The Indo-Pacific is going to be the theatre where history will be written in this century. It is no longer the Atlantic or middle Europe. The fault lines of humanity will be in the Pacific, which will be where the confrontation between China and the US will take place. We have presented an Indo-Pacific strategy which [shows how] we will engage with countries of the region. We don't want to look at the Indo-Pacific just from the [angle] of confrontation between the US and China. I think there is also room for a lot of complementarity. The Indo-Pacific is not just China. [There is] Southeast Asia, vibrant economies, look at the capacity that some of the countries have been developing, like Vietnam for example. In this Indo-Pacific strategy, our relationship with India has an important role. Once again, we take note of the fact that India is the world's most populous country and the 5th largest economy. By the end of this decade, it will be maybe the third-largest economy. So how can the Europeans not have India on their radar screen? Yes, we have it and we know our future will depend a lot on the Indo-Pacific region becoming a peaceful region, rid of the tensions that we have been living with on the European front, trying to calm and control and avoid the confrontation between the US and China. And the fact that China will be also a big geopolitical power. That this happens in a peaceful way, incorporating the new power that China and India will represent in the world. The whole order has to accept the fact that the world is no longer the world of 1945 when India was still a colony and China didn't exist economically. You can see the incredible change the world has gone through in these 75 years. I think it's the biggest transformation in the history of mankind, and the big shift of technological and economic capacity from the Atlantic to the Pacific.

Is there scope for India and the EU to work together to ensure climate justice and climate transition, especially getting developed countries to help the Global South with funds and technology?

The energy transition needed to fight against climate change has to be a just transition. Otherwise, it will not happen. If we are not able to provide to the poor people of the world clean and affordable energy, they will use another one. We cannot ask two-thirds of humanity to stop their development because there is a climate problem. We have to offer a solution that combines both their development, which will require much more energy, with the fact that this energy has to be a different one. This will represent in terms of economics, a creative destruction. Some assets will lose value, some capital will be destroyed by technology changes. It means that something will be lost and if you lose something, it demands resources. We have to understand the fact that two-thirds of humankind needs to consume more energy. The solution will not come by the whole world consuming less energy. We, the developed world, can afford to consume less because we consume a lot in a very inefficient manner. But two-thirds of humanity needs to consume more because their level of development is so low that they cannot be further reduced. In Africa, there are 600 million people that have never seen an electric bulb. How can I tell them to consume less? I cannot consume less when I am consuming nothing. The key question is how do we provide energy which is both clean and affordable? The future of the climate fight will be decided by two-thirds of humanity that is still hungry for energy.

Do you worry that at the end of the day, the Ukraine war is going to suck out all the oxygen from all efforts to address the other challenges you referred to?

Well, Ukraine is not all the problems of the world. Unhappily, there are hundreds of millions of people not living in Ukraine and they have a lot of problems. But Ukraine represents a turning point in modern history. You know the day that my phone rang at 5am and a voice told me they're bombing Kyiv, I understood history has turned a page and we were going to a different world, a world with strong competition, with war again a reality - for us Europeans, war was something that was forgotten, thank God. And that international relations will be much tougher. And power politics was coming in a way that could represent a big threat for humanity.

So no, not all the problems of humanity are represented by Ukraine. But Ukraine is a turning point of our history. The world will be a completely different one, depending on how the war will finish. But we will support Ukraine as much as Ukraine needs because the world should not accept and the world cannot afford the law of the stronger, the law of the gun. Because if this happens in Ukraine, tomorrow it will happen somewhere else. This is the most important argument that I have for all my interlocutors - if the aggressor wins, the world will become a very dangerous place.",2023-03-03T16:07:00Z

Mr. Chandrasekhara Reddy was addressing a seminar organised by the APSECM in collaboration with The Hindu, at PVP Siddhartha Institute of Technology (PVPSIT) as part of the celebrations marking the Energy Conservation Week-2022 on Saturday.

Highlighting the need for adopting energy conservation practices, Mr. Chandrasekhara Reddy said climate change had already affected several cities across the globe, and conservation of energy conservation played a significant role in lessening the impact. ""It helps in replacement of non-renewable resources with renewable energy,"" he said.

Andhra Pradesh won several awards at the national level for implementing best energy conservation practices in industries, he said, and added that it was the only State in the country to initialise the setting up of energy conservation cells in government departments.

He said the State had so far saved 5,600 million units of energy worth ₹3,800 crore by implementing schemes of the Central government.

He called upon the youth to be the agents of energy conservation and promote practices that help people save energy.

Mr. Chandrasekhara Reddy, along with PVPSIT principal K. Shivaji Babu and others, released energy conservation awareness posters on the occasion.

Students of the EEE Department of the college gave presentations on various energy conservation practices.",2022-12-17T15:49:00Z
The Times of India,eac:  Eac Defers Green Clearance Grant To Jsw Project | Bhubaneswar News - Times of India,,"Bhubaneswar: The Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC), under the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF & CC), has deferred the grant of environment clearance to JSW Utkal Steels proposal for an integrated steel plant near Paradip in Jagatsinghpur district.

The EAC that discussed the project on January 28 has sought additional information from its proponent for further consideration of the proposal.

An approval by the EAC is mandatory to go ahead with the project.

The Sajjan Jindal-led group has planned a 13.2 MTPA crude steel, 900-MW captive power and 10-MTPA cement grinding unit. It has also planned to set up a captive jetty near the plant.

The EAC has sought land acquisition details for the proposed project, along with requisite supporting documents, from the company. It asked for the revised plant layout, indicating the exclusion of north-eastern portion, situated towards high tide line and sand dunes existence.

As a patch of forest land exists between the proposed jetty and plant site, the committee has sought details of the forest area and its conservation measures to be adopted.

Among others, the company has also been asked about the details of pending court cases pertaining to the project under consideration, along with its present status, action plan for reuse of water recovered from iron ore slurry and details of 1.3 lakh trees proposed to be felled down and the compensatory afforestation measures to be adopted.

The EAC asked the company to submit an undertaking in a non-juridical stamp paper, stating that no construction activities related to the integrated steel project would be undertaken in the coastal regulation zone area.

Ahead of consideration of the project by the EAC, a group of environmentalists had urged the panel not to give clearance to the proposed steel plant before an independent assessment is carried out to study the project's health impact.

The EAC decision also came barely a fortnight after people of the area, where the plant is planned by the company, clashed with police, opposing the plant.

Environmentalist Prafulla Samantara, who along with others had urged the EAC not to give clearance to the project, said the EACs decision proves that JSW's environmental impact assessment report is not based on facts and proper study. The EAC also returned another proposal for expansion of Bhushan Power and Steel Limited at Rengali in Sambalpur district and asked to submit a revised application.",2022-02-06T00:11:00Z
The Times of India,"Conduct EIA of coal mines, power plant on Tadoba: Parliament panel | Nagpur News - Times of India",,"Nagpur: The Parliamentary Standing Committee (PSC) on science and technology, environment, forests, and climate change has asked the MoEFCC to do an environmental impact assessment (EIA) of Chandrapur and on Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) due to coal mines and thermal power plants near. The ministry should also consider carrying out such assessments of other wildlife sanctuaries/parks affected by industries and power plants.

The fourth report on 'Status of Forests in India' pertaining to the MoEFCC was tabled in both houses of Parliament on February 12, 2019. There were 33 recommendations in the report on which the action taken report (ATR) was submitted in the Parliament on December 1, by its chairman and MP Jairam Ramesh.

The PSC took serious note of various problems plaguing Tadoba. The major issues include four-laning of Chandrapur-Mul-Gadchiroli road and Nagpur-Umred-Nagbhid-Bramhapuri road. Both the roads cut the vital tiger corridor and the PSC has said that it should be ensured that movement of animals across the corridors is not the least restricted while four-laning these roads. TOI was the first to write on the issue.

The panel also recommended EIA of WCL mines and Chandrapur Super Thermal Power Station (CSTPS), located along the southern border of the tiger reserve on the activities of the wildlife needs to be carried out, at the earliest and remedial measures in respect of the adverse impact of the same be taken on priority. The PSC was disappointed as EIA has still not been done.

The committee was also against establishing the major irrigation project on the Human river near Tadoba. If at all it comes, it should be ensured that the tiger corridor between Tadoba and Bramhapuri forest division that connects Satpuda-Maikal Landscape is not cut-off. However, on the action taken, the MoEFCC has said that a team was constituted to suggest options for retaining vital tiger corridors vis-à-vis the proposed Human dam, which submitted its report in 2015 and suggested three options.

It included shifting the location of the project upstream by a distance of 5km, this will make sure that the structural corridor of 5-6 km will be safeguarded downstream and will also reduce the human-wildlife interface on the northern side of the Tadoba and will help in reducing human-wildlife conflict in the area.

Another option was to restore the structural corridor of 3-4 km downstream by acquiring the private land and converting the purchased land into the forest by planting native trees. The construction work will only start once the land is purchased and the first phase of plantation work on the purchased land is completed. The third option included looking for other options for irrigation like developing lift irrigation, barrage, small dams, etc. This option so far has not at all been considered by the irrigation department.

""This is significant as the potential command area has come down due to Gosikhurd overlap,"" the MoEFCC said. On the road projects coming up in tiger corridors, it said areas are being addressed through Section 38 0 (1) (g) of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. EIA of coal mines and power plants impacting TATR shall be taken up soon.

The PSC expressed satisfaction that the number of tourists has been steadily increasing in TATR since 2012-13 and it has positively impacted the revenue generation through wildlife tourism and creating an indirect economy in the area. However, the committee cautioned that tourism in the tiger reserve must be regulated as per the guidelines of the NTCA norms only.",2021-12-11T18:12:00Z
Hindustan Times,Running - not walking - the talk on climate,,"India's climate targets are laudable. But to fight the crisis equitably, the industrialised world must raise ambitions and provide finance, China must reduce emissions

India's targets for the climate crisis, announced by Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi in Glasgow are bold and ambitious -- and challenging. But given the enormity of the crisis, India is not just walking the talk, but running it.

Historically, India has not been a contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. From 1870 to 2019, its emissions add up to a minuscule 4% of the global total. It was lambasted as the world's third-highest polluter in 2019, but its scale of emissions stands at 2.88 CO2 gigatonnes (GT) compared to the two highest polluters: China, at 10.6 GT and the US, at 5 GT. This while India needs to meet the energy needs of millions of its people.

From every angle, India did not have to make these global targets to reduce its carbon emissions. Despite this, India's climate targets are laudable, and they show the developed world that it means business.

Let's decode the targets: The most important is the national commitment to ""reduce projected carbon emissions by 1 billion tonnes from 2021 to 2030."" Taking a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, carbon emissions are projected to be 4.48 Gt in 2030. This commitment means that India's carbon emissions would now be 3.48 Gt in 2030. In other words, the country has set an extremely high target to cut 22% from BAU.

But this does not explain the real change that we have set ourselves to achieve. India's annual per capita emissions would be roughly 3 tonnes in the BAU scenario -- still much lower than most industrialised countries. But now, in the new scenario, emissions will be 2.3 tonnes per capita by 2030.

If you compare this to the rest of the world, the sheer scale of the transformation is apparent. The US, even after the 50% reduction target set by President Joe Biden (which it is in danger of not meeting because of the stalemate in Congress) will see a comparable number of 9.42 tonnes of CO2 per capita in 2030. China, as it has not set any emission reduction target, will actually see the number go up from 7.3 tonnes to 9 tonnes of CO2 per capita in 2030.

India's climate commitment is a challenge for the rest to follow. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global emissions must be 18.22 GT in 2030 for the world to stay below a 1.5°C rise in temperature. If you take the global population in 2030, this means that every person in the world can only emit some 2.14 tonnes of CO2. India's per capita comes close.

The Conference of the Parties (COP) 26 target has to be to match this in every industrialised country. The United Kingdom (UK) -- the host -- has an ambitious climate plan of 2.7 tonnes per capita -- higher than India, and above what the world needs in 2030. Australia, Canada, the European Union (EU), Russia, the US, and China are all way above this. Russia tops this at 13.5 tonnes of CO2 per capita in 2030.

Most importantly, as carbon dioxide emissions accumulate in the atmosphere for 150-200 years, they force temperatures to rise. India has committed not to add to this burden. This natural debt of the industrialised world and China now needs to be paid. And this is why PM Modi has rightly said a massive transfer of funds is required, and that these funds must be measurable. It is ironic that funding for the climate crisis remains non-transparent and without verification.

The remaining targets -- to reach 500 GW in non-fossil energy capacity; to meet 50% of energy requirements from renewable energy; and to reduce the carbon intensity of the economy by less than 45% -- are the roadmap to reach the 1 billion tonnes CO2 emission reduction by 2030.

This is the trajectory of growth for our future and adds substance to the 2030 goal. However, only a few countries -- and not the industrialised world -- have put out their carbon reduction paths with clarity. This, again, suggests what the world must do before leaving Glasgow.

The question remains: Is all of this possible? In terms of the energy mix, reaching 50% electricity from renewable energy (RE) would mean that India will have to up its RE target from 450 GW in 2030 to around 630-700 GW. This is achievable, but will need huge investment. India's coal energy in 2030 -- as per estimates of the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) will be 266 GW in 2030 -- which means that we are capping future growth in this globally indicted dirty energy source.

India has accepted a massive transformation of its energy systems, which will be designed for the future, and compliant with the climate crisis goals.

The big issue will be to ensure that growth is equitable, and that the poor are not denied their right to development in this new energy future. As we set ourselves the goal to grow without pollution, we must work on increasing clean, but affordable, energy for the poor.

The last target is net-zero by 2070 -- though much in the headlines is a non-issue. The fact is that for the world to reach net-zero in 2050, the industrialised world should have committed to a net-zero target of 2030 and China, 2040, at the latest. India could have then been pressured to also commit to net-zero by 2050. But now, the world has set an extremely unambitious and inequitable net-zero target, with most industrialised countries tom-tomming their goal for 2050. This will not keep the world on course to avoid devastating impacts of the climate crisis.

The agenda for COP26 is now clear: Raise the ambition of the industrialised world and commit to even greater cuts by 2030; put the spotlight on China to drastically reduce emissions; and provide the finance that is needed for the transformation -- not transition -- in the developing world. It's within our reach. But will the rich world's leaders now really run the talk?",2021-11-02T13:36:00Z
Hindustan Times,Glasgow climate summit likely to adopt India's plan of global solar grid,,"New Delhi: The Glasgow climate change conference (COP 26) will likely adopt an ambitious plan to build a global solar grid that was put forth by India. The plan is called One Sun One World One Grid (Osowog), and it envisages building a global solar grid that will facilitate the transfer of solar power from one part of the world to another. The International Solar Alliance or ISA is the body in charge of implementing this initiative.

""The government asked ISA to carry out a study on the viability of the initiative. We hope to share a declaration (on Osowog) that can be adopted at COP 26,"" said Ajay Mathur, director general, ISA. TERI, and French energy firms AETS, and EDS are also working on the plan.

Osowog is one of the main issues that will be discussed at the ongoing fourth general assembly of ISA. The others are a $1 trillion investment road map for solar energy generation capacity, and a blended financial risk mitigation mechanism.

The UK and the government of India will also jointly launch a global 'Green Grids Initiative - One Sun One World One Grid' (GGIOSOWOG) at COP 26 focused on global technical, financial and research cooperation to help facilitate cross-border renewable energy transfer projects, ISA said.

The concept of a single global grid for solar energy was first suggested by India at the first assembly of the ISA in 2018. It involves building and scaling interregional energy grids to share solar energy across the globe, leveraging the differences of time zones, seasons, resources, and prices between countries and regions.

""We are assessing the readiness for Osowog which would mean connecting regional grids. The sun never goes down; when one side of the planet is dark there is light on the other side. For example, East Asia gets the first light of sun and it is also where the sun sets first but India still gets sunlight when its sunset in East Asia so electricity can flow from India (to East Asia) during those hours. Similarly, west Asia and Africa can supply electricity to India when it's dark here. The concept offers an opportunity to use solar energy 24 hours a day. ISA is studying the viability of the concept through the World Bank and Électricité de France. They have already found that under certain circumstances this transfer can be economically viable,""explained Mathur at the assembly.

""With India's Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, the World Bank and the ISA signing a tripartite agreement on Osowog, the initiative could be the world's most important renewables catalyst,"" an ISA statement added.

US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, John Kerry and the European Commission Executive Vice President for the European Green Deal, Frans Timmermans will be addressing ISA assembly on Wednesday.

""With the rising share of renewable electricity, balancing demand and supply will become critical. Just as Norway acts as a giant ""battery"" for Europe, so can such an interconnected grid enable India and Asia to effectively use renewable power. Some studies have estimated that at more than 70-80% of renewable energy, the cost of grid integration can grow exponentially. So, building such a grid shows foresight in preparing for the low carbon energy transition,"" said Ulka Kelkar, Director, Climate Program, World Resources Institute India.",2021-10-18T18:47:00Z
The Times of India,"Highest premature deaths in Kolkata due to coal pollution, says global study | Kolkata News - Times of India",,"KOLKATA: A new study by 'C40 Cities' -- a network of the world's megacities committed to addressing climate change -- reveals that Kolkata has the highest number of premature deaths due to coal-fired thermal power plant pollution in 2019 among 61 global megacities. It is also projected to witness 10,000 premature deaths till 2030. For the first time, this new research report by C40 quantifies the impact of air pollution from coal plants on the health of urban populations and its economic consequences.

The residents of Kolkata are the worst impacted by coal pollution compared to residents in other cities in terms of premature deaths. Around 20% of India's coal-powered electricity is generated within 500km of the city. Air pollution from coal-fired power plants travels long distances with the winds pushing pollutants towards the city, thus putting people, especially youths, pregnant women and senior citizens at risk.

""Air pollution (PM2.5 annual concentration) in Kolkata is nearly seven times above the WHO guidelines and nearly twice above the national guideline. Current national plans would expand the coal fleet by 28% between 2020 and 2030, threatening the health and well-being of the urban residents in Kolkata while undermining India's climate and air quality targets. Current national plans could increase the number of annual premature deaths from coal plant pollution in Kolkata by 50%,"" said Rachel Huxley, head of knowledge and research at C40. Current plans to expand India's coal fleet by 64 GW would increase the number of premature deaths to 31,000 from coal-related air pollution in the city till 2030, the study revealed.

""The state and the Centre should consider incorporating an early retirement of coal and invest in clean energy, while not building any new coal plants, as cornerstones of their air quality and climate policies,"" added Huxley.

""However, it is easier said than done. Bengal is geographically rich with its coal resources and the availability of resources often determines the technology to be used, even though none disregard the health implications,"" said a senior state government official.",2021-09-30T00:28:00Z
The Times of India,"Kolkata: Climate change wiped out ancient river, city, says IIT study | Kolkata News - Times of India",,"KOLKATA: The extinction of Dholavira -- the biggest and most spectacular Harappan city in present-day Kutch district of Gujarat -- was caused by the drying-up of a massive river that originated in the Himalayan glaciers in prehistoric times because of climate change, research by a team of scientists from IIT Kharagpur suggests.

The river that ran through the desert of the Rann of Kutch was one of the main sources of sustenance for Dholavira. The scientists, led by geologists from IIT Kgp, said this was the first time that the existence of a perennial river located by a Harappan site was being vouched for.

The findings, which have excited historians and archaeologists across the world, have been published in the Wiley Journal of Quaternary Science, a peer-reviewed academic journal published on behalf of the Quaternary Research Association. It covers research on any aspect of quaternary science, an inter-disciplinary field of study focusing on the Quaternary period, which encompasses the last 2.6 million years.

The scientists said the river dried up because of climate change, when the glacier feeding it melted away. They said the river might remind one of the mythical Saraswati, which is also said to be lost, but is definitely not the same. The researchers have not been able to christen it yet, but have concluded that it might have been a distributary of the Indus, or might have been a ""paleochannel"" that ran beside Dholavira. A paleochannel is a remnant of an inactive river or stream channel that has been filled or buried by younger sediment.

The river existed since prehistoric times but the civilisation started proliferating from 5,500 years ago and died about 3,800 years ago. The research has concluded that when the residents of Dholavira sensed that the river was gradually drying up, they adopted an advanced water-conservation system that helped them to survive for the last 1,700 years.

While the research was led by Anindya Sarkar and his team from the department of geology and geophysics, the other agencies that collaborated were the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), Deccan College PGRI Pune, Physical Research Laboratory, and the department of culture, government of Gujarat.

""Our data suggest that prolific mangroves grew around the Rann, when the river existed in the near southern margin of the Thar desert. This is the first direct evidence of the glacier-fed river, quite like the Saraswati, in the vicinity of the Rann,"" Sarkar said.

Ravi Bhushan and Navin Juyal from PRL, Ahmedabad dated the carbonates from human bangles, fish otolith and molluscan shells by accelerator mass spectrometer and confirmed the dating of the site. From potsherds and other remains found at the site, the researchers have also concluded that the Dholavirans were probably the original inhabitants of the region and had a fairly advanced level of culture even at their earliest stage. The study indicates that the city expanded for 4,400 years followed by an abrupt decline. Researchers R S Bisht and Y S Rawat from the ASI, who originally excavated the site, concluded that the decline was evident in the degeneration of architecture, craftsmanship and material culture of Dholavira.

Arati Deshpande Mukherjee of the Deccan College said: ""We have evidence from high-resolution oxygen isotopes in snail shells Terebralia palustris, which typically grow in mangroves and was a source of food for the Dholavirans."" Researchers also concluded that the snail isotopes suggested that the mangrove was fed by a glacial river that existed near the site. The drying of the river coincided with a mega drought period that is known in history as the Meghalayan drought. ""Indeed, Dholavira presents a classic case for understanding how climate change can increase future droughts,"" added Sarkar.",2020-01-24T01:47:00Z

""It is true I had extended my support to the state government's 'Jal-Jivan-Hariyali Abhiyan' because it is aimed for welfare of all living creatures. I still support the Abhiyan. But I will not join in the human chain because now certain kind of politics is being played over it,"" Singh told TOI on Saturday while outrightly rejecting reports in a section of media which suggest the CLP leader would participate in the human chain, defying the party line.

The state Congress chief Madan Mohan Jha had earlier opposed the human chain and alleged that government fund was being misused in the name of forming human chain.

Singh said, a meeting on the band impact of climate change was convened in the central hall of assembly, a few months back. Members of all political parties participated in the meeting. Moreover, the CM himself visited all districts as part of his Jal-Jivan-Hariyali Yatra very recently. He also held meetings and awareness rallies about the Jal-Jivan-Abhiyan in all districts for the Jal-Jivan-Hariyali Abhiyan. The CM hariyali Yatra was enough to create awareness about the Abhiyan.

""Instead of spending money of human chain, the state government should have focused on planting more saplings and protecting the planted saplings. Are even 10% of saplings planted by the government agencies alive?"" Singh asked.

However, three RJD legislators who recently praised the CM defying their party line, are adamant to join the human chain. The rebel RJD leaders Gaighat MLA Maheshwar Prasad Yadav, Keoti MLA Faraz Fatmi and MLC Sanjay Prasad have not only decided to join the human chain, but they have also appealed their supporters to join the state government's initiative to protect environment.

""I have openly declared to join the human chain. I will participate in it at Chakai under Jamui district,"" MLC Prasad told TOI on Saturday.

""The human chain was being formed to create awareness to protect environment. I have my full support. I even went to Keoti with Darbhanga DM to appeal people to join in the human chain. I will participate in it,"" Faraz told TOI on Saturday.

Though the RJD's top leadership including its president Lalu Prasad, the leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav have openly opposed the human chain and asked their supporters not to join in it.

The Times of India,MoEFCC panel defers green nod to 2 new Koradi units | Nagpur News - Times of India,,"Nagpur: The expert appraisal committee (EAC) of ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC) has once again refused to grant terms of reference for environmental clearance for the two new 660 MW units at Koradi power plant.

Terms of reference (ToR) is the first step in grant of green nod.

The committee, in its latest meeting held this month, has deferred the proposal and asked Mahagenco to submit a revised map showing operational units, proposed project and to cover 33% of the total area by green belt. Mahagenco has also been asked to sanction a map showing piezometric wells around the ash pond.

More importantly, the EAC has stated that MoEFCC may take action against Mahagenco officials for installing flue gas desulphurizers (FGDs) and other issues mentioned in the site visit report.

Mahagenco had applied for ToR for Koradi units on April 20, 2019. The EAC, in its meeting held on May 28, decided to send a team to visit the site. The team visited Koradi in August and then submitted a report to the committee.

EAC then asked Mahagenco to submit an action plan for reducing pollution and complying with other norms. The plan was submitted on November 20.

In the plan, Mahagenco has promised to install FGDs and air pollution control equipments before commissioning the units. As for other units, the company said that order for installation of FGDs on existing three 660 MW units would be placed in November 2019 and installed by December 2021.

FGD will be installed in 500 MW unit at nearby Khaparkheda plant by September 2022. Action had been initiated for consultancy services for installation of FGDs in 210 MW units of Koradi and Khaparkheda plants.

The promises of Mahagenco notwithstanding, while issuing environmental clearance for the three 660 MW, MoEFCC had in 2010 asked the company to install at least one FGD. However, nine years have passed but the generation utility is yet to comply with this directive.

The company in its plan also stated that ambient air quality monitoring was regularly carried out and reports of September 2019 showed that pollutants were within specified norms.

However, both the MoEFCC team and Central Pollution Control Board team had found during their site visits that the levels of particulate matter (PM), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) were far higher than the permissible limits.",2019-12-24T01:06:00Z
The Times of India,"98% state, 96% private power plants yet to process FGDs | Nagpur News - Times of India",,"Nagpur: Flu-gas desulfurizer (FGD) is far from seeing the light of day in 98% of the state-owned and 96% of the private sector thermal power units. A ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC)-mandated technology, the FGD controls toxic sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions from the coal-fired power sector.

The latest analysis by environmental organization Greenpeace India highlights how the largest polluting sector of the country is likely to miss emission-reduction deadlines given by the Supreme Court.

FGD has been installed in just 0.8% of the total power capacity of the central, state and private sector, reveals the report titled 'Four years of emission standard notification for coal-based power plants in India -- A status check'.

The analysis, which is based on the Central Electricity Authority's most recent data, states that the deadline for 1,66,472MW capacity is December 2022. Of this, FGD bids have been awarded for only 22%.

In an affidavit filed in Supreme Court last year, the ministry of power stated that the installation of FGD in a unit takes around 2-3 years from the date of order. Assuming a time frame of two years, analysts found that bids have been awarded for only 18.5% of the capacity bearing a deadline of December 2021.

The report further shows that of the 33 units in Delhi-NCR, only two adhered to the December 2019 deadline.

Experts have projected that most coal-fired plants are set to miss the deadline for a second time. ""After not meeting the initial December 2017 deadline, it looks impossible for a large part of the power sector to honour the timeline provided by the Supreme Court. Absence of interim deadlines by regulators for checking the progress of FGD installation is to be blamed,"" said Avinash Chanchal, campaigner at Greenpeace India.

Environment activist Debi Goenka holds ""a very powerful lobby"" responsible for sabotaging the implementation of tighter emission standards. ""Backed by top environment research institutes, the lobby is putting forward all kinds of facetious arguments, like lack of water and difficulty in transporting lime. However, the water quantity needed for FGD is about 1% of that needed by coal. Lack of water is actually a huge problem for the coal washeries,"" said Goenka, who feels that the only solution is to stop building new coal-based power plants.

Shutting down the ""dirty old plants that couldn't meet emission standards in the given deadline"" will set a stern precedent for other units, said both Chanchal and Goenka. ""The lives of millions of people are at stake,"" they said.

An earlier Greenpeace report stated that India was the world's largest emitter of SO2, having more than 15% of all the anthropogenic pollutant hotspots detected by the Nasa OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) satellite. Almost all the SO2 emissions in the country were found to be generated from burning of coal.

TOI had earlier reported about international researches which warned that India was set to surpass China as the world's largest emitter of anthropogenic sulphur dioxide (SO2), with over 33 million people living in areas with substantial SO2 pollution.",2019-12-11T20:34:00Z

While reviewing the functioning of the RWD at 'Sankalp' hall in the CM residence here, Nitish suggested that saplings should be planted in two or more rows if the roads have enough flanks. ""Planting saplings along the roads will not only save the alleyway from erosion, but also protect environment in the nearby surroundings,"" Nitish said.

The CM asked the RWD officials to find ways for use of plastic waste in construction of roads.

Stressing the need of better maintenance of rural roads, the CM asked RWD secretary Vinay Kumar to develop a proper system for regular inspection of roads by chief engineers and junior engineers. ""Population in the state is increasing year by year and so is the number of vehicles. Hence, the better upkeep of rural roads is very necessary,"" he said.

""Our target is to connect all villages and tolas with all-weather roads,"" Nitish said and asked the officials to complete the work of constructing roads in all the remaining tolas under the Tola Sampark Nischay Yojna.

Referring to Mukhyamantri Setu Nirman Yojana, the CM asked the officials to ensure proper maintenance of bridges constructed under the scheme. He called for a study to find out whether condition of the old bridges constructed in villages was good or not. He also called for early completion of approach roads for the new bridges. The CM said there should be training session for RWD engineers on a regular basis.

Earlier, the RWD secretary briefed the CM about maintenance of rural roads in the state.

https://www.hindustantimes.com/,What we can do to tackle extreme weather events | Analysis | analysis | Hindustan Times,,"India is making an effort. Our choices now will determine the future of oceans, cryosphere, and all life on earth

Buying a sea-facing flat in any coastal mega city in India may bring in challenges, warn climate scientists. The recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) special report on Oceans and Cryosphere in a changing climate made important revelations about the changing characteristics of the sea. It showed that the cryosphere -- the frozen part of our planet -- plays a critical role in sustaining life on earth. People around the world depend on these systems for basic sustenance. However, climate change is causing adverse consequences across these systems. The report warns that these changes will continue and some of them will accelerate in the near future.

The report warns that the global mean sea level is rising, with acceleration in recent decades due to increasing rates of ice loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, as well as continued glacier mass loss and ocean thermal expansion. The ocean is absorbing most of the carbon sink, making it much warmer than before. The impact of the warming ocean means that there will be an increase in the incidence of tropical cyclone winds and rainfall, increase in extreme waves, with relative sea level rise, exacerbate extreme sea level events and coastal hazards. The fish production is also expected to decline.

While the sea level has risen globally around 15cm during the 20th century, it is currently rising more than twice as fast -- 3.6 mm per year and accelerating. The sea level will continue to rise. It is projected to reach around 30-60cm by 2100 even if the greenhouse gas emissions are sharply reduced and global warming is limited to well below 2° Celsius. In the event of high greenhouse gas emissions, it will rise to 60-110 cm. Global warming has already reached 1°C above the pre-industrial level in 2017, due to past and current greenhouse gas emissions. There is overwhelming evidence that this is resulting in profound consequences for ecosystems and people.

The ocean is warmer, more acidic and less productive. The world's ocean and cryosphere have been ""taking the heat"" from climate change for decades, and consequences are expected to be widespread and severe.

So, what does this information mean for India? India has the seventh longest coastline in Asia of 7,500km, stretching from the Arabian Sea in the west to Bay of Bengal in the east. The nine coastal states and two Union Territories have a population of about 560 million. In 2014, around 177 million people lived in coastal districts and 0.44 million lived in island territories in India which are considered to be at a greater risk. This includes mega cities such as Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata along with tier-2 cities such as Surat, Visakhapatnam and Goa.

While events like cyclones will on the rise due to warming oceans, salinity ingress will pollute freshwater bodies and will have huge impacts on water for irrigation and domestic use. The shifting rainfall patterns of the monsoon will also have bearing for people living on the coastal areas. The fish production will decline affecting millions who depend on fish production for their survival. In the last week of September, many parts of peninsular India, the coastal region and sub-Himalayan region received heavy downpour. Hyderabad and Patna have received rains unprecedented in recent history and they barely have the infrastructure to cope with it. The changes we are experiencing show us how vulnerable we are to a changing climate. Though the impacts differ between regions and states, they tend to fall disproportionately on the poor.

Can we do anything to save ourselves from these extreme situations? There are different choices that range from climate-proofing developmental programmes, making infrastructure climate-resilient to adaptation options such as better early warning systems, institutional innovation in tackling disasters and resilient livelihood practices. Combined with this, sustained long-term monitoring, sharing of data, information and knowledge and improved context-specific forecasts, including early warning systems to predict more extreme events, tropical cyclones, and marine heatwaves, help to manage negative impacts from ocean and cryosphere changes. The IPCC report presents the case of Surat that has been setting an example in adapting to climate change. It has set up informal adaptation strategies independent of India's national climate policy that helps in dealing with events such as cyclones. India is already charting an ambitious mitigation plan and moving towards clean energy, which will help mitigate some of the long-term consequences. Banning of single use plastics is a welcome step as it pollutes freshwater bodies and oceans. The choices we make now are critical for the future of our ocean and cryosphere -- and all life on earth. Our future is clearly in our hands.",2019-10-17T14:53:00Z
The Times of India,We want action against climate change: Activists | Bengaluru News - Times of India,,"Bengaluru: ""Enough of talks. Tell the truth. Act now."" This is what activists of the Bengaluru chapter of Extinction Rebellion (XR) had to tell the government about fighting climate change and saving the world from extinction.

XR is a socio-political movement active in 66 countries against climate breakdown and ecological collapse. The campaign uses civil disobedience and non-violent resistance to achieve its goals.

At an event, Climate Satyagraha, here on Friday, Chittaranjan Dubey, coordinator of Extinction Rebellion (South Asia), said many activities have been lined up to highlight the need for governments and the public to act on climate change. ""We are planning to bring hundreds of people on October 7 for the International Rebellion Week,"" he said.

""On the one side, 54% of India is highly water-stressed and many cities are set to run out of groundwater by 2020. On the other side, we see extreme rainfall in places like Mumbai and Kerala. We, as a world, are heading towards extinction if carbon emissions are not tackled,"" said Dubey.

Social activist Mayank Gandhi, who was part of the team that launched India Against Corruption (IAC) in 2011, said India has been the most eco-friendly country and its citizens should not lose track now. ""More than developmental politics, the need of the hour is environment politics. The campaign against climate change should have a clear message; it has to succeed.""",2019-09-07T03:34:00Z
The Times of India,'Nod to interlinking of Kosi-Mechi river soon' | Patna News - Times of India,,"PATNA: State water resources department (WRD) minister Sanjay Kumar Jha said in the state assembly on Thursday that the Centre would soon sanction the Kosi-Mechi river interlinking project in the basins of the Kosi and Mahananda rivers in eastern Bihar.

The minister said the project had been pending with the Union forests, environment and climatic change ministry for clearance. Jha added that he called on Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat on June 17 and sought early sanction to the project.

""The National Water Development Authority has sent the relevant statistical information regarding the project to the Centre's environment and climatic change ministry,"" he added.

The project, which entails an expenditure of Rs 4,900 crore, is aimed at linking rivers in the Kosi and Mahananda basins in the Kosi and Purnia divisions. When completed, it would provide irrigation facility in over 2.10 lakh hectares of land in Araria, Katihar, Purnia and Kishanganj districts, Jha added.

The minister was giving the government's reply to the House debate on the Rs 3,652.30 crore budgetary demand of the WRD for which the cut motion had been moved by senior RJD member Lalit Kumar Yadav on behalf of Abdul Bari Siddiqui. The House passed the budget by voice vote, even as the RJD and CPI(ML) members walked out of the House during the minister's reply.

Jha said the Kosi-Mechi river interlinking project had been declared as a national project, implying that the Centre would meet 90% of the cost and the state government 10%. A WRD project is declared national project if its purpose is to provide irrigation facility to 2 lakh and more hectares of land.

Jha said the department has decided to go for de-siltation of its various reservoirs in a phased manner to increase their water holding capacity, which, in turn, would help in recharging the ground and also prevent the falling of the water table. Besides, the department has decided in principle to give stress on conservation of rainwater, rainwater harvesting and effective water management, he added.

Even as there are fears regarding drought conditions in the state, Jha said the department had selected 208 anti-flood schemes for protection of its 3,390km of embankments in the state and 68km of other embankments in Nepal.",2019-07-05T09:16:00Z
The Times of India,State to come up with carbon footprint app | Nagpur News - Times of India,,"Anandvan (Warora): To create environment awareness among individuals, the state forest department will launch an app that calculates the carbon footprint an individual generates and actions that must be taken to neutralize that.

Announcing this at the opening of 33-crore plantation drive under 'Green Maharashtra Mission in late Baba Amte's Anandvan on Monday, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said, ""The app is expected to be ready in a month and will deal with carbon handprints and carbon footprints. Individuals following these principles will also be awarded.""

Amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere as a result of our actions is termed 'carbon footprint', while handprint is to positive actions towards sustainable development that decrease the footprint.

""Our energy dependency is increasing and carbon emissions are released from almost all our activities. To protect the planet from the perils of climate change, we need to start taking action to heal the planet and reduce our ecological footprint,"" said Fadnavis.

""This is a historic moment. When we had announced the scheme, it was considered populism but by achieving the set targets in the last three years we have not only proved our mettle but also set a model before the country and the world. We will certainly exceed the target by planting 35 crore saplings this year,"" he said.

The chief minister said, in the last decade people had been feeling the heat of climate change and facing alarming drought, scarce rains, rising temperatures, ill effects of pollution etc. ""If the situation continues, time is not far when Maharashtra will turn into a desert,"" he warned.

Making fervent appeal to the mammoth gathering to save the planet, Fadnavis said, ""Environment is like bank balance. If you keep withdrawing from it without adding by planting trees, you will be debt-ridden. Today's generation will somehow manage to scrape through but we need to think of next generation.""

Forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar echoed the same feelings and hoped the massive greening drive in the state would help generate oxygen for next 200 years.

Mungantiwar said the Miyawaki (Atal Anand Ghan Van) will now be implemented in entire state by forest department, municipal corporations and other agencies. ""It is payback time for the people for the resources we are extracting from the mother Earth,"" he said.

The chief minister said Anandvan was selected for launching the drive, as ""the historic place is blend of happiness and forest (Anand and Van) where Baba Amte brought smiles on the face of thousands of people.""

The event also saw release of postal cover on plantation drive by the state in the presence of BJP leaders and a battery of officials. Interestingly, former MLA Shobhatai Fadnavis and aunt of chief minister, who was critical of ambitious plantation drive was also on the dais.

After the event, principal secretary (forest) Vikas Kharge held a 3-hour meeting with senior forest officials at Van Bhavan and directed them to coordinate with other departments to achieve the plantation target.

PCCF (information technology & policy) MK Rao told TOI, ""A core team of officials will discuss modalities for the new app as suggested by the chief minister. It will be a coordinated effort of energy, environment and other departments.""

https://www.hindustantimes.com/,Over-exploitation of water resources threatening Nainital's ecology,Neeraj Santoshi,"Ecology of Nainital and Mussoorie - the two quintessential Himalayan hill stations in Uttarakhand - is under threat due to changes in demographics, climate change, development initiatives, rampant concretisation and lack of long term planning that is in tune with the local environment.

In a four-part series, HT will look into the major problems of these two hill stations which attract hundreds of tourists every year. The first one in the series will focus on the challenges and threats around the water resources, especially the Nainital Lake, the main source of drinking water supply in Nainital.

Paradox of water woes

Anyone who visits Nainital for the first time is generally struck by its beauty, especially that of the Nainital Lake. The visitors generally assume that locals are so lucky to have access to such pristine water resources.

It is hard for them to believe that this hill station in the 'lake of district of India' has been facing water woes over the years, mainly an outcome of the over-dependence on Nainital lake for the drinking water supply and lack of developing an alternative source over the decades.

In 2017, noted classical singer Shubha Mudgal and thousands of others including Mrinal Pande, cricketer Mohammad Kaif, historian Pushpendra Pant even signed a petition on 'change.org' urging Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat to save the Naini Lake from dying.

Google removes app targeting youth with conversion therapy. Google pulled an app touting ""conversion therapy"" for LGBT youth after more than 140,000 people from around the globe -- including dozens of survivors of conversion therapy as well as politicians -- signed a petition.

Over-dependence on the lake

This overdependence on the lake water resources here coupled with other factors has created its own set of problems, which will consolidate in the coming time if timely steps are not taken.

Nainital Lake, the lifeline of people here, is under threat due to increased stress on its water resources due to anthropogenic factors like surge in population over the decades which has led to drawing up more water from the Lake.

The other main factors that threaten the survival of this Himalayan lake include drying up of its source - Sukhatal, increasing siltation, constructions and encroachments on the slopes around the lake, eutrophication of the lake waters due to the entry of solid waste, construction debris and other pollutants into the lake waters, climate change and comparative warming up of the Himalayas.

Also, despite installing sewer lines to prevent sewage entering the lake, some effluents from drains and leakage still make their way into the lake.

Fluctuating water woes

Nainital, with its limited water supply, has been batting water woes, especially in peak summer months, when tourist influx increases substantially, with over 2,000 tourist vehicles making their entry into Nainital a daily, which rises to 4,000 to 6,000 tourist vehicles on the weekends.

Realising the dangers of over-extraction of water from the lake, last year administration decided to curtail withdrawal of water from the Lake to 8 million litres per day from the earlier 18 MLD. But now as summer is here and water requirement has increased, the administration has again decided to increase the water intake from the lake incrementally by half a million litres per day (MLD) after every 15 days for the coming few months.

Authorities are also planning to lift water from Kosi River near Khairna, nearly 30 km from Nainital, by creating one-kilometre long barrage in the river. The project is estimated to cost around ₹575 crore, according to preliminary estimates. Experts and some geologists had come earlier this year to Nainital for checking pre-feasibility of the project.

Expert take

Environmentalists, experts and locals are expressing serious concern over increasing stress and overexploitation of Nainital Lake and emphasising on lack of term planning to manage the resources.

Vishal Singh, an expert on Himalayan water bodies and deputy executive director at Doon-based Centre for Ecology Development and Research (CEDAR), said solutions to the problems in Nainital should be found locally, as most engineering based solutions from outside are just patchwork and limited in scale compared to the whole ecology of the hill station.

Singh said he along with researchers from the geography department of Cambridge University have studied the critical water sources of Nainital lake over the years.

""It is a complex problem. In our study, we found that the revival of Sukhatal and depressions on the slopes here was critical for the long term survival of the Nainital Lake. Sukhatal, nearly one kilometre above the lake, alone supplied nearly 40 to 50% of the subsurface water to the Nainital lake,"" he said.

""The problem is that the lake is not getting water recharge from the depressions and recharge zones on the slopes here. With a huge number of constructions on the slopes, the runoff has increased and seepage has decreased. This has affected the recharging capacity of the lake here,"" he said.

Singh said the basic problem is lack of proper management and long term planning. ""The solutions should be Nature based. Things like aeration of lake water are end of the pipe solution. We have to strengthen the recharge sources and natural recharge capacity of the lake,"" he said.

What authorities say

Vinod Kumar Suman, district magistrate of Nainital, said since last year, steps were taken to lessen the dependence on the Nainital lake by cutting down the daily intake of water from the lake to around 8.5 MLD. ""Due to this, the water in the lake has increased by many feet, allowing us to go for an incremental increase in water intake given the increase in the water requirement during the summer months. Other measures are also being taken consistently to save the lake here,"" he said.",2019-05-27T10:26:00Z

The Times of India,"EAC defers Kattupalli port expansion, forms panel - Times of India",,"CHENNAI: The expert appraisal committee (EAC), constituted by the ministry of environment, forests and climate change, has ordered the formation of a sub-committee comprising of three experts to visit the Kattupalli port in Tiruvallur district. The proposal has been deferred until submission of a report by the sub-committee, the committee decided.

The committee has also asked the project proponent to get a fresh environmental and coastal regulation zone (CRZ) clearance for the establishment of a captive jetty for ultra mega power project (UMPP) in Panayur village in Kancheepuram district. The decisions on both were taken during the EAC (Infrastructure) meeting held from March 26 to 28.

As far as the Kattupalli port expansion is concerned, the committee said it received representations from three fishermen sabhas -- from Thirumalai Nagar, Pazhaverkadu and Vairavankuppam. Apart from this, the committee has also received letters from environmentalist Nityanand Jayaraman and citizen consumer and civic action group.

The fishermen sabhas and activists have raised issues regarding site selection, including economic viability and impact on ecologically sensitive due to the expansion of the port. The fishing community also pointed out that the expansion work will affect their livelihood, fishing grounds and their villages.

The committee said they received more representations and after deliberations, it recommended the formation a three-member sub-committee with H C Sharatchandra, V S Naidu and M V Ramana Murthy. They have to conduct a site visit and submit a report to the EAC. ""In view of the foregoing observations, the EAC recommended deferring the proposal. The proposal shall be reconsidered after the receipt of the report from the sub-committee,"" it said.

Explaining about setting up UMPP at Cheyyur village in Kancheepuram district, Coastal Resource Centre member K Saravanan said an environmental clearance was issued seven years ago. However, it was challenged by activists. The initial idea of using imported coal was dropped and it was decided to use local coal. The project proponent submitted an application for change in the coal source. The ministry had issued an environmental clearance for the establishment of a captive jetty for UMPP on November 30, 2012.",2019-04-08T03:43:00Z

On Friday, over 600 students bunked school to gather at Wazirabad bundh - location of a group of life-size art installations created from waste - to take part in the Global School Strike for Climate Change. As the father of one of the participating students asked, ""What will the students do sitting in school when there is no clean air outside?""

Recently, data compiled in the IQAir AirVisual 2018 World Air Quality Report prepared in collaboration with Greenpeace Southeast Asia revealed that five out of the top 10 most-polluted cities in the world are in Delhi-NCR with Gurgaon being at the number 1 spot.

The students took inspiration from Swedish student and political activist Greta Thunberg who had in August 2018 called for a school strike. Thunberg has been nominated for the Nobel peace prize this year.

The children made banners out of waste material, on which were highlighted the pressing issues of the day - air pollution, climate change, a proposed road that would have cut through the Aravali Biodiversity Park. There was also rapping, dance performances and a slogan march. Shivi admitted to feeling extremely ""charged"", knowing that many people were voicing their concern for the environment.

Campaign group Fridays For Future, which is tracking these protests across the world in 112 countries and 1,787 locations, reports that 186 strikes were planned in Germany, 126 in the US and 123 in Italy. The rallies covered all inhabited continents, and featured events in Brazil, Iran, Japan, India, Ukraine and Russia among other countries. And with Gurgaon now officially the world's most polluted city, students from Pathways, Heritage, Shri Ram and Excelsior American schools turned out in big numbers, along with their parents.

One of these peaceful protesters was Arya Dhar Gupta (13). Terming pollution as 'millennial cancer', Arya explained that the demonstration was totally aggression and intimidation- free. ""We wanted to make a point on how government is pro-development but it should not ignore the environment. Even the United Nations report says India is the world's most polluted country. All of us signed our hand-prints as a signature to mark the protest,"" said this British School student.

In Delhi, too, about a hundred students from over 15 schools came out to participate in the strike. At Central Park in Connaught Place, they took turns to speak about the harmful effects of pollution and global warming. They also asked the governments to care for their future.

""Instead of talking about how other countries are better, we should start to create a better India. There is plastic everywhere and even the cows eat those,"" said a student.

Asees Kandhari (15), who called herself a 'climate rebel', said, ""This is not climate change, this is climate breakdown. We will have to face the worst. You adults have done the damage and need to radically change your ways. We can't afford to rest until you have done that.""

Madhur, a participant at the event, spoke to the children about how she, a pregnant woman, is worried about her future in NCR. ""There's dust and pollution everywhere. How do I protect my baby when he can't get healthy air in the city? I request politicians to include pollution as an election issue,"" she said. Many students also requested politicians to bring in new legislation to improve the environment and air quality. ""Companies care only for sales and profit.

The Times of India,"File report on forest land where realtor cut 6,000 trees, government told - Times of India",Shilpy Arora,"GURUGRAM: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Tuesday directed the ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEF&CC) to submit the final report on the status of a 52-acre Aravali land where trees were felled allegedly by a realty firm, within three weeks.

The ministry had been asked by the tribunal to set up a committee to probe the alleged tree-felling.

""The MoEF&CC was required to take a decision on the inquiry report filed on August 17, 2018, which was said to be pending for consideration before the ministry. The counsel for the MoEF&CC seeks further time to comply with the directions. Let the same be now compiled positively within three weeks,"" states the order (a copy of which is with TOI).

The order released on Wednesday also states, ""Let the same (report) be now compiled positively within three weeks, failing which the inspector general, forest conservation, will have to remain present before this tribunal on the next date.""

The tribunal was hearing a plea filed in June 2017, which alleged the Haryana government had given its permission to fell 6,000 trees and clear a 52-acre land in a deemed forest for a housing project of a real estate company.

The ministry, upon the green tribunal's instructions, appointed a high-level committee in July 2017 to prepare a report to analyse the objections raised by a few environmentalists in the case.

Rahul Choudhary, counsel for the petitioner, told TOI, ""Though a report was submitted in the case by the ministry sometimes ago, the final inquiry report is yet to be filed. The court has given three weeks to the ministry for submitting the report."" The report submitted by the ministry's regional office said the trees were felled in the forest area which also came under the natural conservation zone (NCZ).

Several environmentalists welcomed the tribunal's order. Vaishali Rana Chandra, an environmentalist, said, ""It is a good move as the NGT has finally taken a stern decision and set a deadline for submitting the final inquiry report or else the Haryana government and even the environment ministry would have sat on it. It is unfortunate that the environment ministry has the authority to direct the state governments to act but it doesn't pressure them to function effectively. Hence, people are left with no choice but to knock the doors of the courts.""

Many activists felt that the environment ministry's report would give a clearer picture of the ground reality at the site where the trees were felled.

""Traces of trees can be tracked easily during an inspection. The idea to formulate the committee was to make it clear if trees were there. The committee report can clarify many things, but unfortunately it has been pending for a long time"" said Vivek Kamboj, a city-based environmentalist.

The major contention pending before the NGT is whether the 52-acre area is a forest area or a hillock where no construction activity is permitted.

According to environmentalists, a decision in the case can have a huge implication on the status of 50,000 acres of Aravali land, which is still placed under 'status-yet-to-be-decided' category by the Haryana government. Even though the state government, many times, assured that the status quo would be maintained in the 50,000-acre Aravali land falling under the 'status-yet-to-be-decided' category, the permission to fell trees on the 52-acre land was given by it, according to environmentalists.

The petition highlighted that the land in question is 'gair mumkin pahar' in the Aravalis, which was put under the category of 'status-yet-to-be-decided' of NCZ in 2015. The real estate construction is not permissible in NCZs, and the overall cap on construction is only 0.5% of the area. The next hearing of the case is scheduled for February 20, 2019.",2018-11-28T20:53:00Z
The Hindu,U.N. Security Council needs to be reformed without delay: India,,"India's Permanent Representative to the U.N. Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin said the 15-nation council is all about primacy but with little purpose.

India has said that the United Nations Security Council needs to be reformed without delay or else it will be left to nurse its self-inflicted wounds of ""diminishing relevance"" in a world awash with challenges like armed conflicts, terrorism, refugee crises and climate change.

Participating in a General Assembly session on 'Report of the Secretary-General on the Work of the Organisation' on Monday, India's Permanent Representative to the U.N. Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin said the 15-nation council is all about primacy but with little purpose.

""Updating the current architecture of international institutions, which are so out of sync with the modern world, is imperative if new global challenges are to be met. Nowhere is this need for common purpose required more than in reforming the Security Council,"" Mr. Akbaruddin said in United Nations.

""We need to fix the flaws. We need to do it before it is too late. We need to do so before the technologies of the future sharpen the conflicts of the past, while the Council remains nursing its self-inflicted wounds of diminishing relevance,"" he said.

Mr. Akbaruddin asserted that nations cannot pose as guardians of a status quo that no longer exists.

""We need to undertake a new journey towards a reformed and reinvigorated multilateral system. Whether we do so or not will determine the destiny of this organisation. It is a decision that all of us who see the benefits of multilateralism will need to take, if we desire to stem the tide against it,"" he said.

Mr. Akbaruddin pointed out that during the recently concluded high-level week of the U.N. General Assembly, nations heard about pressing global challenges including armed conflicts, terrorism, large movements of peoples fleeing conflicts that are increasingly straining societies, climate change events becoming more regular, environmental challenges becoming more urgent and multiple ailments hamstringing efforts to improve global health.

""We also heard clearly that the uneven impacts of these cataclysmic changes are causing enormous discontent and all this churning is testing multilateralism as never before,"" he said.

Emphasising that the world is awash with challenges that the current institutional arrangements are ill equipped to handle, Mr. Akbaruddin said new technologies were increasingly changing the nature and dynamics of international conflict.

Cyberwarfare, unmanned aerial drones, and combat robots are just three instances of technological change shaping the future of warfare and raising profound ethical and normative questions, he said.

""Similarly, there is no global approach in dealing with basic issues regarding frontier technologies,"" he said, questioning that while the internet is becoming ubiquitous, what rights do individuals have to privacy, how should tensions between individual liberties and collective security be mitigated.

Mr. Akbaruddin said that neither the General Assembly was addressing developmental and normative aspects, nor was the Security Council addressing the peace and security implications.

""This is but one of the many new areas where international mechanisms for cooperation and collaboration are either weak or incomplete or non-existent,"" he said.

As in the case of frontier technologies, so in other areas such as climatic shifts, debt sustainability, counter terrorism, illicit financial flows and tackling pandemics, nations should be considering scenarios and preparing plans to prevent upheavals and taking stronger steps to mitigate risks.

""Many of these problems require continuous attention rather than one-shot solutions. To counter terrorism, for example, we need to establish a reliable and efficient set of controls for monitoring borders and financial flows. Such efforts will work only if appropriate standards are widely adopted and cooperation in implementing them becomes routine,"" he said.

Stressing that proliferating global problems demand new narratives and new forms of cooperation, Mr. Akbaruddin said international cooperation of a nature and kind not thought of before was needed to promote climate action required by the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report released on Monday.

""We cannot focus merely on exterminating bugs while allowing life-threatening wild beasts to roam free. We cannot spend our time in clearing the weeds, oblivious to the growth of the jungle all around us.

""If we do so, we will be nursing an establishment that has declined almost to the vanishing point with respect to overarching challenges that states acting on their own cannot hope to overcome,"" he said.",2018-10-09T06:37:00Z
The Times of India,"'2,000MW solar power by 2022' - Times of India",,"PATNA: Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi (SuMo) said on Sunday the power plants at Pirpainti in Bhagalpur and Kajra in Lakhisarai, which were initially proposed to be coal-based thermal power plants, would now be solar power plants.

""The two power plants are slated to be commissioned by 2022 and each will produce 350MW of electricity using solar energy. The state government is committed to producing 2000MW of electricity through solar energy by 2022,"" SuMo said at the East India Climate Change Conclave here.

Elaborating on other steps being taken by the state government for the cause of environment protection and averting climate change, he said no brick kilns would be allowed to operate without adopting to clean technologies. ""The brick kilns which operate on clean technologies required three tonne less coal in producing one lakh bricks as compared to the conventional kilns,"" SuMo said.

He also said 15 crore saplings would be planted in Bihar over the next five years to increase the green cover in the state.

Speaking on the impact of climate change in Bihar, SuMo cited the example of damage caused to the maize crop due to excessive low temperature conditions in the last winter. ""Sprouting could not happen in the standing maize crops due to extreme winter conditions. Consequently, the total maize production went down by 12 lakh metric tonne in 201718, compared to 2016-17. Around 1 lakh farmers in 14 districts were affected by it,"" he said.

SuMo said the state agriculture department was working on projects entailing an estimated outlay of Rs23 crore sanctioned under National Adaptation Fund on Climate Change. He also said the Centre had given in-principal approval to a state government scheme entailing an outlay of Rs339 crore under Green Climate Fund.

He also proposed to rename state environment and forests department as department of environment, forest and climate change on the lines of the Union ministry. CM Nitish Kumar, who was also present, gave his consent to the proposal.",2018-06-25T07:00:00Z
The Times of India,It's not all bad: Some coral reefs are growing despite climate change - Times of India,M T Saju,"CHENNAI: Coral reefs are on a decline globally. But it is in the understanding of the disturbances, which change the structure and functioning of the diverse underwater ecosystem, that lies the answer of preservation, at least for some of them.

Despite the dwindling numbers of corals, over the years scientists have noticed some positive behaviour in coral reefs in some areas. In Lakshadweep, several climate change-related coral bleaching events in the past two decades have resulted in a loss of coral, but more importantly, a shift has been noticed in the kind of coral species that dominate today, says Shreya Yadav, a PhD student in coral reef ecology at University of Hawaii.

""A decline in some fast-growing, structurally complex coral species since 1998 has been paralleled by an increase in more stress-tolerant coral taxa. These shifting coral communities will impact not only the speed at which reefs can recover after a disturbance (slower today, because of the slow-growing nature of the coral community), but also associated reef organisms,"" she said, adding that understanding links between shifting coral communities, reef fish movement and reef fishing will be crucial to brace for effects of warming waters.

Shreya said some coral species have been found to survive rising temperatures and disturbances in weather patterns in Lakshwadeep. ""This is a positive sign. This knowledge will be useful for setting up coral management systems in other regions too,"" said Yadav, during a talk on 'In hot water -- understanding coral reef response to repeated disturbance in the Lakshadweep islands' at MS Swaminathan Research Foundation on Tuesday.

But how did the reefs become more resistant? There are many reasons. One of them is herbivorous fish, which according to Yadav plays a major role in Lakshadweep. ""It has become increasingly clear that herbivores play a critical role in driving the resilience of the Lakshadweep reefs by mediating competitive interactions between coral and algae, thereby making substrate available and preventing a phase shift to an alternate stable state dominated by the algae,"" she said. But what is still unclear is how herbivory varies across these reefs and if the distribution of herbivores is directly linked to the function they perform on reefs, said Shreya, referring to a previous study she did with Nature Conservation Foundation, Mysore.

Referred to as the 'rain forests of the sea', coral reefs are diverse underwater ecosystem held together by calcium carbonate structures secreted by corals. It provides shelter to a variety of organisms ranging from microscopic plankton to larger mammals like dolphins. During the 2004 tsunami, it was the coral reefs that reduced the speed and impact of waves, helping prevent loss of life in the coastal belts of Sri Lanka and certain areas in Indonesia.",2018-03-13T19:17:00Z
The Times of India,"After CM letter, Centre defers MPT coal handling expansion - Times of India",Murari Shetye,"Panaji: The expert appraisal committee (EAC) of the Union ministry of environment, forests, and climate change (MoEFCC) has deferred a decision whether or not to recommend the ministry to grant an envirionmental clearance (EC) for the expansion of South West Port Limited (SWPL) to increase its coal handling capacity.

The state government recently wrote to the Centre opposing the expansion. The EAC has also asked the project proponent to reply to the state government's letter and to queries raised during public hearings.

Apart from this, the EAC has also sought point-wise replies to concerns expressed during the public hearing, and also a statement of representations received during the additional period of seven days after the public hearing.

""The proposal was therefore deferred till the desired information is submitted,"" the EAC stated. As per procedure, the EAC recommends an EC to the project proponent and only thereafter does the MoEFCC grant it.

In August 2017, chief minister Manohar Parrikar had written a letter to the MoEFCC not to allow SWPL to increase its coal handling capacity until the level of particulate matter in Vasco is well within stipulated standards.

Parrikar also asked the MOEF to direct SWPL to take measures to control coal pollution in the port town.

During the committee's deliberation, the committee noted that a letter has been received from government of Goa which states that the Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) conducted public hearings for the proposal on May 26, 27, and 29, 2017, during which the public opposed and objected to the proposed increase.

The GSPCB's air quality monitoring reports indicate that the particulate matter (PM) exceeds prescribed limits for the present handling capacity. The board has already directed the South West Port to reduce their present handling capacity by 25%.

The EAC noted that the concerns raised during public hearing have not been addressed satisfactorily.

The CM, in his letter, had said that technological solutions are available for controlling pollution, including construction of closed shed, and SWPL should be directed to take such measures before considering their application for increasing coal handling capacity.

SWPL operates berth 5A and 6A at the Mormugao Port Trust (MPT)

SWPL handles cargo like coal, limestone, and steel products by cranes, ship unloaders and wagon loading system.

SWPL has proposed to deploy highly mechanized and efficient environment-friendly material handling systems so that the cargo handling capacity at the berth is increased consequentially

Thus, total cargo to be handled is expected to go up to 12 to 13 MTPA of bulk (consisting of coal, iron ore, lime stone, dolomite, bauxite, mineral ores and other miscellaneous cargo), and about 2 MTPA of unitised cargo (consisting of steel bars, coils, flats and plates, and other steel products)

The total cargo handling capacity hence is expected to increase to about 14 to 15 MTPA

MPT will be benefitted by means of increase in revenue from SWPL

The Times of India,Household weather meter to be a reality in Surat soon - Times of India,Himansshu Bhatt,"Surat: Surat Climate Change Trust (SCCT) and Urban Health Climate Resilience Centre (UHCRC) plan to install household weather meters atop individual houses and apartment blocks in the city for rainfall and temperature prediction. This micro-level set-up, besides weather forecast, would also give information with figures on air and water pollution in the area.

The weather meters would also provide information on release of water from Ukai reservoir and water levels in Tapi River during monsoon. The plan would be implemented in phases from 2017. Surat will thus become first city to have such weather meters that would be linked to the Smart City centre.

""Surat is taking a lead in reducing the impact of climate change in future city. Weather meters in individual apartments would help inhabitants to properly assess a situation and as a result the entire population could help in taking the required steps. The plan is to fit the weather meters first atop major commercial buildings and then in new constructions,"" SCCT chairman Jatin Shah said.

""The micro-level data from intra domestic and domestic meters could be stored and analysed for future forecast to understand its impact on human life. The data could be related to parameters such as human health, economic growth, comfort and other things,"" UHCRC executive director Vikas Desai said.

""The micro-level set-up could be used in eco-friendly building and the data generated could be an important factor for the retrofitting of old structures in the city. It will take us towards becoming a smart city,"" She said.

The city has virtually become a concrete jungle with 15 lakh houses. There is a big difference in temperatures in two parts of the city. ""There is difference of 4 degrees Celsius in the temperatures at Varachha and Athwalines.

In such a situation, a micro-level weather meter would not only provide us accurate data of prevailing pollution level of an area, but help us to gain insight and take necessary steps,"" municipal commissioner Milind Torwane said.",2016-05-18T03:29:00Z
The Times of India,Iceland reaffirms support for India's permanent UNSC seat - Times of India,,"New Delhi, April 5 (IANS) Iceland's Foreign Minister Gunnar Bragi Sveinsson on Tuesday reaffirmed his country's support for a permanent seat for India in the UN Security Council.

During a meeting here, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Sveinsson ""affirmed the urgent need for a comprehensive reform of the United Nations Security Council, including its expansion in both permanent and non-permanent categories, so as to make it more effective, efficient and representative of the contemporary geopolitical realities"", according to a joint statement issued by the external affairs ministry after the meeting.

""Iceland reaffirmed its support for India as a permanent member in an expanded United Nations Security Council,"" it stated.

""The two countries expressed support for forward movement in the intergovernmental negotiations on United Nations Security Council reforms, and reiterated their commitment to initiate text-based negotiations within the 70th Session of the UN General Assembly.""

Both the ministers also agreed to continue strengthening bilateral economic relations such as in the areas of renewable energy, particularly geothermal energy, tourism, start-ups and extended trade relations.

""They agreed that a trade and economic partnership agreement between India and the EFTA (European Free Trade Association) countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland) would facilitate more economic relations between the two countries,"" the statement said.

Sushma Swaraj and Sveinsson discussed the challenges of climate change for the Arctic and the Himalayan regions and the importance of continued scientific cooperation aimed at understanding better the implications of climate change for the ice covers and glaciers in the two regions.

""They also acknowledged that any economic activities in these ecologically fragile regions needed to be based on the principle of sustainable development,"" the statement said.

Both the ministers also stressed their shared interest in promoting women's rights and gender equality.

Sveinsson briefed Sushma Swaraj on the second Barbershop Conference to be held at the UN in New York in May this year.

The Barbershop Conference is aimed at reflecting the casual setting in which men get their hair cut, while delving deeper into gender stereotypes perpetuated by social norms, and helping dispel the fallacy that women and girls cannot be equals in the economic, social or political life.

""Both ministers agreed to encourage the participation of UN permanent representations in the event,"" the statement said.

Sveinsson and Sushma Swaraj also condemned terrorism in all forms and manifestations.

""They reaffirmed that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable regardless of their motivations, whenever and by whomsoever committed,"" the statement said.

They also called for early adoption of the India-initiated Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism.

""Both ministers also underlined their shared interest in strengthening global non-proliferation objectives. In this regard, Iceland expressed its support for India's membership in the relevant multilateral export control regimes,"" the statement said.

The Times of India,'New rules to ensure disposal of hazardous waste in environmentally sound manner: Javadekar - Times of India,,"New Delhi, Apr. 3 (ANI): Minister of State (Independent Charge) of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Prakash Javadekar on Sunday released the Hazardous Waste Rules 2016 to distinguish hazardous waste from other wastes.

Speaking on the occasion, Javadekar said, ""The new rules will ensure resource recovery and disposal of hazardous waste in environmentally sound manner. The rules are environment and industry- friendly.""

""The provisions of the new rules are in line with this Government's priority for Ease of Doing Business and Make in India, but with responsible concerns for sustainable development,"" said Javadekar.

The Hazardous and Other Wastes (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules 2016 includes other waste as well; waste management hierarchy in the sequence of priority of prevention, minimisation, reuse, recycling, recovery, co-processing; and safe disposal.

Under the rule all forms for permission, import/export, filing of annual returns, transportation, etc. have been revised significantly, indicating the stringent approach for management of such hazardous and other wastes with simultaneous simplification of procedure.

The basic necessity of infrastructure to safeguard the health and environment from waste processing industry has been prescribed as Standard Operating Procedure (SOPs), specific to waste type, which has to be complied by the stakeholders and ensured by SPCB/PCC while granting such authorisation.

Procedure has been simplified to merge all the approvals as a single window clearance for setting up of hazardous waste disposal facility and import of other wastes.

Co-processing as preferential mechanism over disposal for use of waste as supplementary resource, or for recovery of energy has been provided.

The approval process for co-processing of hazardous waste to recover energy has been streamlined and put on emission norms basis rather than on trial basis, while the process of import/export of waste under the rules has been streamlined by simplifying the document-based procedure and by revising the list of waste regulated for import/export.

The import of metal scrap, paper waste and various categories of electrical and electronic equipments for re-use purpose have been exempted from the need of obtaining the ministry's permission.

The basic necessity of infrastructure to safeguard the health and environment from waste processing industry has been prescribed as Standard Operating Procedure (SOPs) specific to waste type.

Responsibilities of State Governments for environmentally sound management of hazardous and other wastes have been introduced, which includes setting up/ allotting industrial space or sheds for recycling, pre-processing and other utilisation of hazardous or other waste; to register the workers involved in recycling, pre-processing and other utilisation activities; to form groups of workers to facilitate setting up such facilities; and to undertake industrial skill development activities and ensure safety and health of workers.

Hazardous waste means any waste, which by reason of characteristics, such as physical, chemical, biological, reactive, toxic, flammable, explosive or corrosive, causes danger to health, or environment. It comprises the waste generated during the manufacturing processes of the commercial products such as industries involved in petroleum refining, production of pharmaceuticals, petroleum, paint, aluminium, electronic products etc.

Other wastes include waste tyre, paper waste, metal scrap, used electronic items, etc. and are recognised as a resource for recycling and reuse. These resources supplement the industrial processes and reduce the load on the virgin resource of the country.

As per the information furnished by CPCB in the year 2015, a total hazardous waste generation in the country is 7.46 million metric tonnes per annum from about 44,000 industries. (ANI)",2016-04-04T06:47:00Z
The Times of India,17 Indian explorers spellbound by Antarctica - Times of India,,"Bengaluru, March 27 (IANS) Seventeen young Indians have returned from Antarctica with breath-taking stories of its icebergs, icy winds, weather and inhabitants - penguins, seals, whales and sharks.Bengaluru, March 27 (IANS) Seventeen young Indians have returned from Antarctica with breath-taking stories of its icebergs, icy winds, weather and inhabitants - penguins, seals, whales and sharks.

""It's an out of the world experience. It's like being to another planet, where nature opens up its treasures and beckons humans to discover the earth's last great wilderness,"" International Antarctica Expedition (IAE) member D. Chandrika told IANS.

Chandrika cruised back to Ushuaia in Argentina on Friday from the 12-day adventurous trip, with 149 other members from 26 countries.

The 17 Indians, including eight women and nine men in mid-to-late 20s, are university students, techies, researchers, executives and greens with a common cause to save earth from ill-effects of greenhouse emissions, rapid urbanisation, excess consumption of natural resources and changing lifestyle.

Organised by the US-based 2041 Foundation under the leadership of veteran polar explorer and British environmentalist Robert Swan, the expedition studied the impact of climate change due to global warming for promoting renewable energy sources, sustainability and preserve the earth's fragile ecosystem.

Swan, 60, the first person to set foot on North Pole and South Pole in 1989, set up the Foundation in 1991 to preserve Antarctica by promoting recycling, renewable energy and sustainability to combat affects of climate change.

Setting off in 'Ocean Endeavour', the luxury ship navigated by 50 crew members, from Ushuaia, the world's southernmost town, the expedition sailed on March 14 towards the Antarctica Peninsula crossing the stormy Drake Passage and entering the blue waters of the ocean with no land in sight anywhere.

""In the midst of the ocean, we spotted the first iceberg near Land Ahoy Island, making everyone hit the deck and brave the icy winds to watch the floating spectacle, with huge twisted forms of ice in many layers and markings, revealing their age and origins,"" the 28-year-old astrophysicist from Pune recalled with awe.

Cruising along the edge of the world, the ship reached the Deception Island, sitting on a dormant volcano and where the illegal whale industry once thrived. Covered with ash and other volcanic remnants, the desolate place is home to hundreds of penguins and seals amidst floating glaciers around the island.

""I found it surreal to walk next to those wild animals, which are not used to humans. They showed no interest in us or fear as they were in their own rightful place,"" French photographer Josselin Cornou, a part of the 2016 expedition, posted in the official blog.

On the following day, the ship entered Port Forester Island through Neptune's Bellows, where a volcanic crater's walls were breached by the mighty sea. The island was discovered in 1819-20 by explorer William Smith.

The expedition also landed at Telefon Bay, a stunning landscape made of ash and snow. About 100 and odd members of different nationalities disembarked from the ship and headed in zodiacs to the snow capped island, swarmed by Gentoo penguins, a napping Weddel Seal and the territorial fur seals.

""The lifetime expedition is educative as we saw the impact of climate change on Antarctica due to emissions from industries and power plants on other continents and the need to combat them with technologies like carbon capture and storage,"" another IAE member, Aarthi Rao, a green activist from Hyderabad, told IANS.

According to Swan, decorated the British Order of Empire, the purpose of the expedition was to engage and inspire the next generation of leaders to take responsibility to build resilient communities and save Antarctica.

""We have seen hundreds of Humpback, Minke, Fin and even Orca whales on the Petermann Island, a low-laying island surrounded by blue icebergs. Every new creature revealed the beauty of these incredible animals,"" Eitan Rovero-Shein, a 25-year-old Mexican, wrote in the blog with amazing pictures.

""You are presiding over a historic COP where agreement has been secured for loss and damage funding arrangements including setting up a loss and damage fund. The world has waited far too long for this. We congratulate you on your untiring efforts to evolve consensus,"" Mr. Yadav said addressing the Egyptian presidency. Loss and damage refers to destruction caused by climate change-induced disasters.

""We note that we are establishing a four-year work program on climate action in agriculture and food security.Agriculture, the mainstay of livelihoods of millions of smallholder farmers, will be hard hit from climate change. So, we should not burden them with mitigation responsibilities.Indeed, India has kept mitigation in agriculture out of its NDCs,"" he said.

On the establishment of a work program on just transition, Mr. Yadav said for most developing countries, just transition cannot be equated with decarbonisation, but with low-carbon development.

""Developing countries need independence in their choice of energy mix, and in achieving the SDGs (sustainable development goals). Developed countries taking the lead in climate action are, therefore, a very important aspect of the global transition,"" he said.

The ministers renewed their commitment to work for the expansion of Security Council membership to include representation from emerging and developing economies of Asia, Latin America, and Africa in both the permanent and non-permanent categories for achieving a representative, inclusive, equitable, responsive and effective U.N. Security Council which is reflective of the contemporary global realities, it said.

They even agreed that the current composition of the U.N. Security Council no longer reflects the realities of the contemporary world and that reforming the UNSC is critical.

On climate change, they reaffirmed their commitment to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), its Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement. They urged all countries to work together for the implementation of the Paris Agreement based on the principles of the UNFCCC, including the principles of ""equity"" and ""common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities"", according to the statement

They underscored the importance of the full implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and highlighted the need to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalise the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development, it added.

They urged the developed countries to fully honour their Official Development Assistance (ODA) commitments and for providing new and additional financing and the means of implementation of the SDGs, the statement read.

The eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, must be aligned with national efforts and international cooperation as it represents the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, they acknowledged.

They also expressed concern over the continuing public health, social and economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic globally and especially in the countries of the Global South and called for better international preparedness to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and other current and future health challenges, including through mobilisation of political and popular support, as well as necessary financial and technological resources.

The leaders also appreciated the significant progress achieved in the development and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine and called for further cooperation among the various stakeholders to ensure the timely availability of a diversified portfolio of vaccines to all those who need it, at affordable prices, it said.

They called on all countries, international agencies, and philanthropic organisations to procure vaccines and boosters from manufacturers in developing countries, including in Africa and among the BRICS countries.

IBSA exemplifies the spirit of South-South cooperation. The IBSA Fund is a special feature of the IBSA collaboration. It has since its inception, allocated over $44 million, supporting 39 South-South cooperation development projects in 35 partner countries with the majority being Least Developed Countries.

The Times of India,PVUNL poses hurdle in realising phase down of coal promise | Ranchi News - Times of India,,"Ranchi: Patratu Vidyut Utpadan Nigam Limited (PVUNL), the joint venture company of National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) and Jharkhand Bijli Vitaran Nigam Limited (JBVNL), is likely to prove to be a roadblock in realising the dream of net zero emission by 2070 or phase down of coal, as promised by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the COP26 in Glasgow last month.

The 4000-MW thermal power plant that was supposed to complete its first phase of 3X800-MW capacity by 2019 is running behind schedule. According to the agreement, signed with the state government in 2015, the project is to be completed by 2024.

Despite using supercritical thermal technology, which reduces the requirement of fuel for steam production, the new-age plant is far from considering carbon capture and sequestration or flue gas to methanol conversion technologies -- two effective ways for reduction in carbon dioxide emissions.

In an RTI query, filed by Patratu resident Ashiwani Kumar Central Public Information officer, NTPC Shantimoy Nandan has said CCS or flue gas to methanol conversion technology is not being envisaged now. ""No hazardous effects on the environment of the upcoming plant are envisaged as the systems for emission control are being designed as per guidelines stipulated by ministry of environment and climate change and central pollution control board,"" Nandan said in his reply.

The CPIO has, however, dodged another query of the RTI application, which sought the corporation's response on what it (NTPC) is doing in Jharkhand to help India achieve its Paris Climate Agreement. The CPIO said the question was vague and cannot be replied.

The NTPC has shown its commitment to add renewable energy with a total installed capacity of 1295.5MW of renewable energy comprising solar, wind and small hydro in nine states and one union territory. However, the list does not include even a single commissioned project in Jharkhand.

Climate activist and founder Damodar Bachao Abhiyan, Gulab Chandra said moving towards net zero by 2070 would remain a distant dream unless thermal power projects are completely shelved. ""PVUNL is not a new plant but augmentation of the pre-existing PTPS. Apart from being fuel-efficient, it should also consider reducing emissions,"" he said.

Another environmentalist, member of 350.org movement and protagonist of Save karanpura campaign, Padma Shri Bulu Imam believes it's already too late to cut down on emissions and expect the environment to get cleaner. ""We have already damaged the environment to irreparable levels and a catastrophe is imminent. Now it's time to extend humanitarian relief and work to save the population that faces the maximum threat,"" he added.",2021-12-05T00:21:00Z

The Times of India,Government unveils urban agenda for next 20 years - Times of India,,"New Delhi, Oct 3 (IANS) Stressing the need to go for a big push to fully realise the benefits of urbanisation, the government on Monday unveiled its urban development strategy for the next 20 years.

Union Minister for Housing & Urban Poverty Alleviation M. Venkaiah Naidu released the ""India Habitat III - National Report"", ahead of the UN Habitat III Conference in Quito, Ecuador, slated for later this month. A global ""New Urban Agenda"" for the next 20 years is likely to be adopted at the conference.

Speaking at the launch ceremony in Vigyan Bhavan here, Naidu on Monday said: ""The agenda for the next two decades proposed in the national report will be ensuring economic growth and productivity, improving quality of life, and importantly, addressing issues of inclusivity, sustainability and climate change.""

The challenge is about ensuring sustainable development while taking advantage of economic growth that results from rapid urbanisation in the country, he said.

""For long, urbanisation has been looked at from the limited perspective of providing basic services. But our contemporary response shall be wide ranging, aiming at serving larger macro-economic transformational goals together with meeting local priorities. We need to go for a big push to harness fully the potential of urbanisation,"" said Naidu.

Elaborating on the strategy for transforming urban India, the minister said it would be achieved through elimination of barriers to the flow of factors of production, like capital, land and labour, and development of rural and urban areas, in a synergetic manner.

The minister said that the outcomes of new urban agenda based on sustainable urban planning would include reducing water and electricity use by 50 per cent from that of normal use, enabling over 60 per cent of urban travel by public transport, generating half of power from renewable sources, and compact and cluster urban development, among others.

""It's an eloquent testimony of India's commitment to sustainable development,"" said Naidu on India ratifying the Paris Agreement on Climate Change on Sunday.

Naidu also announced that under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban), construction of 10,10,424 houses for urban poor has been approved.

""An investment of Rs.59,771 crore has been approved with the central assistance of Rs.14,955 crore,"" he added.

Hindustan Times,Water desalination plant at Manori gets coastal authority nod,,"Mumbai: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)'s seawater desalination plant at Manori was cleared by the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) on November 2. Principal Secretary of the state environment department, Pravin Darade, confirmed the development.

Darade is the chairperson of MCZMA, who gives crucial permission for any projects close to the coast and covered by Coastal Regulation Zone notification of the Environment Protection Act. ""Mumbai currently has all surface water storage reservoirs and whenever there is a monsoon failure, the water cuts cannot be ruled out. The late onset of monsoon and early withdrawal of monsoon also results in water cuts, inconveniencing citizens, P Velarasu, BMC's additional commissioner (projects), said. ""Climate change is another major concern, and it is very important that Mumbai has diverse water source portfolios. In this regard, the Desalination plant is a blessing for Mumbai. BMC will meet total energy requirements from green energy or will produce equivalent green energy for this project. If we consider the life cycle cost analysis, the cost of production of water is only marginally higher than conventional methods. This project will make water cuts in Mumbai a history.''

The project will come up on land which was leased to Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation and Velarasu said that they had written to the collector of Mumbai Suburbs to hand over the land to BMC. Sources in the state government say that many had eyed this land for years. The BMC has already made a budget provision of ₹200 crore in the budget this year and it will be spread over 12 hectares.

The desalination plant was one of the pet projects of Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Aaditya Thackeray.

So far, the alliance government led by chief minister Eknath Shinde has scrapped many of Aaditya Thackeray's beautification projects - mostly in his Worli assembly constituency but this one is being implemented by the civic body.

Thackeray, who was Mumbai's guardian minister for suburbs in MVA rule said, ""The desalination plant basically would give us an ideal amount of water supply at a minimal cost. It was ₹1200 crores initially when we initiated it. I wanted to always shift Mumbai's water supply away from complete monsoon dependency, and this was a step in that direction. Thankfully, CM Uddhav Thackeray ji fully backed the idea, and this could have been scaled up for most of Maharashtra. It's crucial that we think beyond the monsoons for our water supply. Monsoons will now be erratic.'' He added that permissions have come quite late, they should have come last year.

Last year, the civic body appointed a consultant to conduct a feasibility study, and a detailed project report was done in November 2022. BMC officers said that the plant is being set up instead of the Gargai dam project, which was proposed to increase the water supply to the metropolis by 440 million litres per day (MLD). The Manori plant's initial capacity will be 200 MLD and can be expanded to 400 MLD. The BMC and state had canceled the Gargai dam project, which would have meant cutting five lakh trees and instead drawing the same quantity of water from the desalination plant.

The BMC had studied spots like Madh, Sewri Manori, and Marve, of which Manori was found to be ideal. The technology used in the plant is based on desalination plants in Israel, which have over two decades of experience in taking water from the Mediterranean Sea and treating it through a process called reverse osmosis. Five desalination plants along Israel's coast provide nearly all the tap water for the country. Dubai, too has a desalination plant at Jebel Ali, which is powered by gas.",2023-11-06T02:34:36Z
The Times of India,"Engg College Gets Automatic Weather, Air Quality Station | Pune News - Times of India",,"Pune: Pimpri Chinchwad College of Engineering got its first solar-powered automatic weather and air quality station on Friday through a grant from the US Consulate General, Mumbai.

Professors Neal Phillip and Paramita Sen of Bronx Community College of the City University of New York's department of chemistry, earth sciences and environmental sciences, inaugurated the system.

""We have already installed 14 such weather stations in India and more will come in. The idea is to make available local weather data to the people so that there is more awareness about climate change at a local level,"" Sen said.

Weather data is available to anyone who wants to check through the Davis WeatherLink smartphone app. It will be made available to all of India and the rest of the world through IBM's Weather Underground Network.

""We have realised that researchers are interested in using this weather data to study the Indian monsoon and global climate change,"" Phillip said.

Sen said that a hackathon will also be organised next year based on climate change and related fields.

""Currently, through the weather and air quality station, we are checking parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, ultraviolet index, air quality and other parameters,"" Sen said. They will introduce soil moisture monitoring and other parameters, Phillip added.

The US Consulate General in Mumbai is working with Phillip and Sen to install weather monitoring stations at seven higher education institutions in western India and to train students and faculty members to monitor and utilise weather-related data which is part of a worldwide climate change initiative.

""The grant activity includes the installation of solar-powered automatic weather, air quality monitors, organizing STEM workshops related to weather monitoring and climate change and a judged climate change poster competition for students,"" the official release from the US Consulate General in Mumbai said.

The department of environment and climate change has conveyed this to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), which had criticised Goa's absence of a monitoring system to protect its coral reefs.

The environment department, in its reply to the CAG, said that it has initiated the process to bring the entire ambit of protection, conservation, and management of marine biodiversity, including coastal tourism, under one nodal agency -- the forest department.

It also informed the CAG that all waterborne tourism activities are considered watersports activities, and are under the total regula-tory control of the department of tourism. ""The forest department is not a stakeholder, although several instructions are issued by the forest department with regards to water sports in Goa whenever NOCs are sought by the authorities,"" the environment department said.

It further told the CAG that, recognising the importance of marine biodiversity and the need for its conservation, a marine cell has been created in Goa to protect, preserve, conserve, regenerate, restore, enrich, and maintain biodiversity... having direct or indirect impact on human life, as well as the conservation of endangered species of coastal and marine fauna such as corals, turtles, coastal birds, and marine mammals. The cell will also intervene to ensure sustainable fishing.

The cell's other objectives are to promote livelihoods, culture, development of eco-tourism communities, rights of those dependent on these ecosystems, and to build research and academic capacity in the field of coastal, island, wetland and marine ecosystems. These will inform policymaking, act as a repository of information, and build the foundation for capacity building and welfare programmes, the department said, adding that the cell will also contribute to the overall goal of coastal, island, wetland, and marine conservation.

The marine cell, which will include the North Goa marine range and South Goa marine range, will cover all coastal areas of Goa. ""The process of constituting a dedicated marine division has already commenced and is under consideration of the government of Goa for approval.""",2023-11-03T19:14:52Z
The Times of India,SRFTI director's documentary on climate refugees makes it to Indian Panorama | Kolkata News - Times of India,Priyanka Dasgupta,"KOLKATA: A documentary on climate refugees made by SRFTI director Himanshu Khatua has been chosen in the non-feature category of the Indian Panorama. Satabhaya, once a cluster of seven villages in Odisha, is said to be the first region affected by climate change. During the shooting of 'The Sea and Seven Villages', the last native village and a temple fought the wrath of the sea.But the sea gobbled everything by the time the shooting of the documentary was over.

In 2020, Khatua visited Bhitarkanika National Park. ""As an eco-tourist, I heard stories of people shifting in Satabhaya since their villages were getting washed away. At that time, I was heading a television channel in Odisha. I wanted to visit those people. Eventually, we managed to meet these 500-odd families in the Bagapatia climate refugee colony in Rajnagar of Kendrapara district. The sea had taken away their land but it couldn't take away their memories,"" Khatua said.

The temple was in ruins by the time the shooting of 'The Sea and Seven Villages' got over

He decided to make a documentary but didn't visualise it as a talking-head initiative with villagers only narrating their individual plight and memories of their homeland. So, the director decided to visit the villages that were affected. ""These villagers would often visit their deserted homeland that was some 16 km away from the climate refugee colony. But sadly, nothing survived. I remember shooting a temple. In the past, it was situated at the centre of all seven villages. During the course of my shooting, I saw how the waves lashed on to its façade and broke it down. The last footage I have is of the ruins of the temple in the middle of the sea,"" he said.

What struck the director further was how the sea had also left little room for accessing the terrain now. ""The only motorable road is no longer there. The domesticated animals that were left behind died a slow death because of lack of freshwater,"" he rued. What was worse was the condition of the villagers in the refugee colony. ""The government had given them land where they could stay but it didn't have any provisions for generating livelihood. As a result, the younger generation soon shifted out to earn as migrant labourers. The colony only houses the elderly people who survive on whatever the younger generation sends back to them,"" he added.

The selection of this film in the Indian Panorama has come as good news on the SRFTI campus. On being asked about how he balances his time between making cinema and working at SRFTI, Khatua said, ""I have become an administrator and cannot get time for my profession. It's very difficult to handle both the things together. As long as I am there in SRFTI, I will be fully dedicated to my job as the director.""",2023-10-31T09:30:54Z

""A free, open and rules-bound common maritime order is a priority for all of us...Respect for maritime laws enunciated in UNCLOS 1982 (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ) must be our lodestar,"" Singh said in his keynote address at the Goa Maritime Conclave here.The defence minister identified climate change, piracy, terrorism, drug trafficking and illegal fishing as challenges that need friendly nations to come together and share information.

He reminded the participating nations that ""strength lies in cooperation and collaboration"" on identified priorities and ""by avoiding ruinous pursuit of selfish goals that make the region less secure and less prosperous"".

""At times, conflict and non-cooperation appears more beneficial in terms of our immediate narrow and unenlightened self-interest,"" Singh said.

""Our narrow, immediate interests may tempt us to flout or disregard the well-established international law, but doing so would lead to the breakdown of civilised maritime intercourse,"" he said.

The three-day conclave, which commenced on Sunday, is being attended by Bangladesh, Indonesia, Madagascar, Malaysia, Maldives, Mauritius, Myanmar, Seychelles, Singapore, Sri Lanka and Thailand. Pakistan and China have not been invited.

Maldives president-elect Mohamed Muizzu had recently promised to evict Indian military personnel from the archipelago. While Singh did not specifically name any country, he did say that lack of trust and cooperation between nations can lead to suboptimal outcomes.

""Our common security and prosperity cannot be preserved without us all committing to cooperatively adhere to the legitimate rules of engagement. Fair and just rules are crucial for ensuring that no single country is involved in a hegemonic manner,"" Singh said.

The Times of India,Power-packed Pandals Spread Green Message | - Times of India,Sudipto Das,"Kolkata: Several clubs have focused on green initiatives this year to showcase different environmental issues and crises as their puja themes. Badamtala Ashar Sangha, Gariahat Hindustan Park and Jadavpur 96 Palli are among the organizers who have highlighted concerns like global warming and deforestation. The green themes also include water and food crises, along with the bane of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) flexes that are used during the puja.

Badamtala Ashar Sangha has created an urban forest made of eco-friendly materials. ""The placement of big mirrors, supporting light effect, aroma of different natural elements and sounds create a perfect illusion of a forest at the pandal,"" said Debatosh Kar, the theme artist. The puja budget here is about Rs 35 lakhs. The theme is 'Protirup' (The Reflection), said club president Sandip Chakraborty.

Jadavpur 96 Pally at Sulekha More is worshipping tree as Goddess Durga in its 50th year. The theme name -- 'Brikkha Moder Matri Shakti' -- denotes the importance of trees in our daily life. ""Indiscriminate deforestation for the sake of urbanisation results in irreparable damage to our environment, which we need to protect,"" said organising committee secretary Dipanjan Dutta.

In its 93rd year, Hindustan Park Sarbojanin's theme 'Pran' (Life) has been executed by artist Raju Sarkar. The pandal exterior is designed as a sawmill. ""More than 14,000 abandoned firewood collected over the last three months from the city's outskirts are used to shape up the interior as a metaphorical representation of the theme,"" said Sarkar.

Patuli Sarbojanin Durgotsav focuses on water and food crises. ""The interior is full of life-size paintings and sound effects to show the harsh effect of drought on humans with supporting exterior to spread environmental awareness among the masses,"" said theme maker Surajit Roy Chowdhury.

Suruchi Sangha emphasises on the usage of expensive banners for their puja advertisements. They used lead-free colours instead of PVC flex as part of their environmental awareness campaign. ""The green initiative has raised the puja budget by 30% but we are committed to environmental causes,"" said Swarup Biswas, general secretary of the puja, which erected 350 such green banners.

Similarly, Khidderpore Sarbojanin Durgotsav went against corporate advertisements and designed their pandal based on the central theme 'Utsav e Bigyapon'. They have decorated their green initiative pandal with more than 1500m of cotton banners.

Meanwhile, to make this Durga Puja eco-friendly and educational, Millets and More in collaboration with Hulladek Recycling, SwitchOn Foundation and The Twirl Store organised a workshop for children that focused on waste segregation, e-waste awareness and the art of upcycling old clothes.

The Times of India,Central govt team arrives today to discuss eco-sensitive villages | Goa News - Times of India,Murari Shetye,"Panaji: A seven-member committee constituted by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change will arrive in Goa on Friday to deliberate with stakeholders and the state government before finalising villages in the Western Ghats as ecologically sensitive areas (ESA).

The team, headed by retired IFS officer Sanjay Kumar, will thereafter visit villages proposed to be excluded from the ESA. It will also hold consultations with stakeholders in the Canacona and Sattari talukas on Saturday and Sunday, respectively, and will meet the chief minister, the environment minister, the chief secretary and environment secretary on Monday. Interactions will be held with MLAs, sarpanchs and panchs of the village panchayats concerned, too.

In July last year, the Union environment ministry had issued a draft notification proposing that 99 Goan villages spread over 1,461 sqkm be declared as eco-sensitive zones. This is the third draft notification it has issued and the first after the state requested the Centre, in 2020, to drop 30 villages from the list.

Prior to this, the Kasturirangan committee on Western Ghats had identified 99 Goan villages as eco-sensitive zones. The Mhadei, Netravali, Cotigao, Bhagwan Mahavir and Bondla wildlife sanctuaries had been included in the eco-sensitive zones identified in the report.

Sawant had subsequently written to the Union environment minister stating that while the draft Western Ghats ESA notification sought to cover 99 villages -- now 96 because two villages no longer exist and one was repeated -- a closer study revealed that most villages did not meet the Kasturirangan report's criteria.

It had further pointed out that there are four talukas that partly come under the Western Ghats, none of which meet the stipulated criteria. In all four cases, only a minuscule percentage of the total area is 600m above MSL -- Canacona (0.2%), Dharbandora (2.5%), Sanguem (4.9%) and Sattari (4.9%). The state thereafter went down to the village level to identify those that meet the criteria of having 20% of area above MSL.

""As far as the height criteria is concerned, although these villages have a maximum height of more than 600m above MSL, only three strictly fulfil the criteria of having more than 20% of their area above MSL. Still, we are recommending 30 villages to be included in the final notification for the Western Ghats ESA,"" Sawant had stated.",2023-10-12T19:29:27Z
The Times of India,Licence To Sandalwood Units Quashed By Govt | Nagpur News - Times of India,Vijay Pinjarkar,"Nagpur: In a setback to the forest department and the state-level committee (SLC) headed by PCCF (HoFF), the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) has quashed its decision to grant wood-based industry licences to two sandalwood units at Ahmednagar.

The SLC had on June 21, 2023, granted permission for sandalwood cutting and processing to two parties -- SR Gadekar, Pimpalner, and Siddheshwar Prakriya Udyog, Parner -- both in Ahmednagar district. The permission was given on the ground that the parties had sandalwood on their farms.

The SLC decision was challenged before the MoEFCC by environment lawyer Vijay G Chauhan under the Wood-Based Industries (Establishment and Regulation) Guidelines, 2016. He said the two proposals were approved by the respondent-SLC, headed by former PCCF (head of forest force) YLP Rao, without the mandatory 'timber availability report' for the state of Maharashtra. The lawyer contested that the SLC decision was against the SC order of October 5, 2015.

Though the respondent parties including the forest department denied having violated rules and apex court orders, MoEFCC questioned whether the sandalwood assessment study by Ahmednagar forest officials was valid.

Deciding the appeal by Chauhan, deputy director general of forests (DGF), central, VN Ambade ruled, ""The SLC has followed a micro-approach of assessment which is beneficial only to a few individuals. lf macro-approach of assessment is followed the SLC can fix the capacity of every industry that is aspiring to set up their units. The micro-approach of the SLC may open a Pandora's Box when people may start applying for a new wood-based industry based on timber in their farms. A teak grower may apply for a sawmill praying that he will use teak only from his farm to feed his sawmill. Granting licences to new wood-based industries based on the sandalwood scenario may be utilized or misutilized by other growers.""

The order further states that, ""It's a well-known fact that the forest department does not have adequate manpower to check malpractices. Hence, the assessment of timber before the grant of licences is an integral part of the guidelines from the order passed by the SC, and therefore cannot be escaped. The states are bound to obey the court orders.""

The MoEFCC quashed and set aside the granting of licences to the two sandalwood processing units. The SLC has been directed to issue appropriate directions to all concerned in this regard.

Hindustan Times,"At a one-day festival, desi comic book artists to tell stories of our times",,"MUMBAI: A cut away from the spectacle of the annual Comic Con events, the one-day The Indian Comics Festival, which will be held in Bandra on Saturday is an attempt to showcase works of contemporary writers who are using the literary form to discuss pressing issues such as climate change, mental wellness and existentialism, illustrated in atypical styles.

While many readers are rooted to Tinkle, Amar Chitra Katha and Chacha Chaudhary, and western imports from Detective Comics (DC) and its famed universe of Batman, and Superman or Marvel Comics's (MC) iconic characters such as Hulk, Captain America and Black Panther, Anand RK, an independent comic artist and participant, said, ""We have our own talent pool of comic creators, who lack the financial support to release and promote their books."" Anand received the Will Eisner Comic Industry Award, touted as the Oscars of the comic world, in 2021.

""There is also a misconception that comic books are just for children. There are many creators delving into layered subjects. It's really for everyone,"" said Likla Lall, a comic book writer. ""Comic books today are a sharp literary tool, used to narrate stories of our times with arresting visuals,"" said Suha Khopatkar, another creator. ""We need more platforms like these to show how contemporary Indian comics have evolved.""

So, at the House of Pandora, a restaurant and bar in Bandra, today, ""writers, illustrators and graphic designers will meet, while fans of comic books can interact with them,"" said Jude D'Souza, who runs the Revolver Club, an audio store in Mahim, and a co-founder of the event. ""The works are on par with Japanese Mangas and American comics. But the creators need to connect with the right audience,"" said Hamza Sayed, owner of Comic Book Store, in Bandra, and co-founder of the event. Sayed himself was surprised by the number of Indian comic artists around when he opened his store four years ago, and ""promised to help promote their work and find new audiences"".

The day-long event will have comic creators RK, and Abhijeet Kini of the comic book series 'Angry Maushi' talk about their careers, artistic journeys and inspirations. Doodle artist and illustrator Santanu Hazarika and illustrator and board game designer Ayushi Rastogi will discuss storyboarding and story-telling. This will be followed by a panel discussion on the future of Indian comics and music performances.

Alongside, around six Indian comic creators will showcase and sell their works at no cost. Khopatkar will display her illustrated book 'Just Give Me Some Space', on the pressures of an architecture student to excel; her other work 'Batata Pav and All Things Portuguese', written by Vaishali Shroff, discusses the relationship between Indian and Portuguese rulers; while 'Dear Creativity,' is an introspective work where she has a conversation with her creative side.

Most comic creators are college students or fresh graduates and do not have enough

funds to self-publish, or buy expensive display stalls at larger comic festivals. The other shortcoming faced by writers is that publishers print only few comic books and the payments are paltry. ""Not many creators can sustain themselves by just creating comics in India,"" said RK, who took up side gigs when he started out. However, since 2019, he has managed to focus on his craft, thanks to assignments from American studios.

The festival has also announced an open competition for young comic creators, which has already garnered 30 entries. The winner's work will be published by The Comic Store.",2023-10-07T02:46:13Z
The Times of India,'climate Change Major Catalyst For Amphibian Decline' | - Times of India,Deepthi Sanjiv,"Mangaluru: Habitat destruction and disease have been recognised as significant factors contributing to the decline of amphibians. However, a study conducted by more than 100 researchers and 1,000-plus experts worldwide pooling their data and expertise, analysing two decades of global data, revealed that climate change is increasingly becoming a major threat to frogs, salamanders, and caecilians. This research work was published on Wednesday in the scientific journal 'Nature'.

The study, 'Ongoing declines for the world's amphibians in the face of emerging threats,' is based on the second global amphibian assessment, coordinated by the Amphibian Red List Authority, which is a branch of the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Species Survival Commission's Amphibian Specialist Group, hosted and managed by Re:wild. The assessment evaluated the extinction risk of more than 8,000 amphibian species from all over the world, including 2,286 species evaluated for the first time. It found that two out of every five amphibians are threatened with extinction. These data will be published on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

According to the study, between 2004 and 2022, a few critical threats have pushed more than 300 amphibians closer to extinction. Climate change was the primary threat for 39% of these species. Amphibians are particularly sensitive to changes in their environment.

Dr Gururaja KV, paper co-author and faculty at Srishti Manipal Institute of Art, Design and Technology, Bengaluru, said that it is high time that amphibian conservation goes beyond awareness. ""It should include research on habitat, bioacoustics, behaviour, and evolution. In India, 30 researchers evaluated 426 species, of which 136 are in the threatened category. Among the states with high amphibian diversity, Kerala has 178 species of which 84 are under threat, Tamil Nadu is next with 128 species of which 54 are under threat and Karnataka is in third place with 100 species of which 30 are under threat,"" he said.

The Times of India,Mining resumption likely to be pushed to next year | Goa News - Times of India,TNN,"Panaji: The December deadline to resume mining activities is likely to be delayed as the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) has deferred the proposal to grant environmental clearance (EC) to M/s Vedanta Ltd, which has proposed a production capacity of three million tonnes per annum at the Bicholim mineral block.

Chief minister Pramod Sawant assured the state legislative assembly in July that mining operations would commence by November or, at the latest, December. Sawant said that the three mining companies that bagged mining leases through the e-auction process are ready to extract iron ore before March 2024.

The state government has auctioned nine iron ore mineral blocks across the state, mostly in North Goa. Vedanta is the only company so far to have held a public hearing for the EC.

The expert appraisal committee (EAC) of the Union environment ministry has sought additional information from Vedanta Ltd. for the EC. The project proponent has also been informed that the public road needs to be bypassed for ore transportation and that the possibility of increasing truck capacity to reduce the number of trips needs to be explored.

The EAC also said that the project proponent needs to revisit the traffic load by considering the cycle time and waiting time and submit an action plan for strengthening the road and converting the unpaved road into a concrete one.

""Since the mine lease area shares a common boundary with the Mayem forest, the project proponent needs to submit a letter from the state forest department regarding the involvement of forest land in the mine lease area,"" the committee said.

""The project proponent needs to submit a letter from the department of geology and mining, government of Goa, clarifying whether any illegal mining within the mine lease area has been carried out or not and whether the same has been carried out by M/s. Vedanta Ltd or not,"" the committee said.

The project proponent also has to submit the video recording of the public hearing, the committee said. People of Bicholim want mining to resume, a public hearing of Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) had confirmed.",2023-10-03T22:50:54Z
Hindustan Times,EAC puts off decision on request to greenlight Goa mining block plan,,"PANAJI: The Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) of the ministry of environment, forests and climate change has deferred a decision on a proposal to allow the resumption of a mining block in Goa after a 10-year gap, observing that it was ""not convinced"" with the plan for pollution control and mitigation measures as well as the mines.

Vedanta Ltd, which won the right to exploit the Bicholim Mineral Block, the first mining block that went under the hammer in auctions held in December last year, had sought a quick restart of mining operations in the block that it was operating prior to the ban in 2012 with proposed production capacity of 3 MTPA (metric tonnes per annum) along with crushing and screening plant capacity of 4.0 MTPA.

Vedanta told the EAC that extracting 3 MTPA will involve excavating material of 28.162 MTPA of which 25.162 MTPA will be waste.

The company suggested that it will attempt to mitigate the waste generated through a plan for backfilling and with the design of settling ponds.

""The EAC was of the view that the pollution potential will be more in handling of waste. The EAC is not convinced with the plan for backfilling and with the design of settling ponds as the annual rainfall is projected as 3500 mm/year,"" the committee said, according to the minutes of the meeting.

Among other issues, EAC said that ""there are two habitations such as Mulgao and Lamgao and schools are located within the mine lease area"". It added that one was located 138 metres from the ultimate mining pit and the second was located 190 metres from the ultimate mining pit.

""The EAC observed that the instant mine is located in a dense vegetation area. The EAC also noted that the mine lease area is located close to the proximity of the habitations, school, forest (Mayem common boundary), river, temples, caves and fort. The EAC also observed that the Project Proponent has not properly worked out the traffic load. Many litigations were received against the public hearing/project,"" the EAC noted.

""Thus there is a need to ascertain the present scenario and ground reality with regards to handling of waste, settling ponds, location of waste dump w.r.t habitation, school and river, other surface features as forest (Mayem common boundary), temples, caves and fort, mineral transportation route and traffic congestion. The EAC was of the view that a site visit needs to be conducted by a sub-committee comprising of EAC members and officers from MoEF&CC,"" the committee said.

It said that it was deferring the proposal for want of following additional information and called on the project proponent ""to revisit the plan for backfilling with clearly indicating the voids area and the capacity available/required for backfilling"" among other changes.

The committee also sought that Vedanta submits a letter from the Department of Geology and Mining, Government of Goa clarifying whether any illegal mining within the mine lease area has been carried out or not and whether the role of Vedanta was called into question in any illegal mining.

A spokesperson for Vedanta Sesa Goa said that the queries are ""part of the process"". ""The clarifications sought by the Expert Appraisal Committee are part of the Environmental Impact Assessment process. Vedanta Sesa Goa is committed to adherence to regulations and to resumption of mining in Goa in a responsible and transparent manner,"" the spokesperson said, in response to a request for a reaction..

The Goa government's Department of Mines and Geology was invited to the EAC meeting to discuss the present status of mining in the state. It supported the resumption of mining in the state, saying that the state was ""looking positive to restart the mining operations in Goa.""

In its submission, the state said it was looking forward to the revenue that will accrue in the form of the 10% which will be filled in the District Mineral Fund, as well as a further 10% in the Goa Iron Ore Permanent Fund.

Vedanta emerged as the successful bidder for the first block of iron ore leases that went under the hammer in December last year, promising to share with the state 63.55% of the average sale price as set by the Indian Bureau of Mines, which was the highest offer at the time of opening the bids.",2023-10-02T14:58:45Z

Hindustan Times,"Desalination plant to help Malad, Kandivali residents",,"MUMBAI: In a fortnight, the BMC will invite tenders for its ambitious desalination project aimed at providing potable water to the residents of Malad and Kandivali. Given the uncertainty of the monsoon every year and in an endeavour to combat climate change, the civic body has been looking at an assured source of water supply.

The seaside village of Manori has been identified for setting up the desalination plant, which will have an initial capacity of 200 million litres a day (MLD), which in future can be expanded to 400MLD. ""A provision of ₹200 crore has been made in the budget for this project,"" said a BMC official from the water supply department. ""The capital expenditure on construction will be ₹2,066 crore, and then there is the energy cost for 20 years. Renewable energy (energy from natural sources) will be used to make this project viable.""

The civic official said that the initial 200MLD of treated water would be distributed to Malad and Kandivali. ""So, instead of these areas getting potable water from the Bhandup filtration plant, they will get it from this desalination plant,"" he said. ""The water needs of the city are increasing very rapidly. We can no longer just depend on rainfall and our seven reservoirs, and need to tap other sources.""

When asked how the desalinated water would be distributed, the civic official said, ""There is already a shaft at Mahavir Nagar in Kandivali West, and whatever water comes from the Manori plant will be released directly into the Kandivali shaft and then sent to Malad and Kandivali areas through the distribution network.""

The plant will be set up on 12 hectares (29.6 acres) of government-owned land at Manori village. This land was earlier leased to the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC), and the BMC will acquire it through the suburban collector.

The civic official said that the marine work and structure constructed in the sea would have a 400MLD capacity. ""The capital expenditure will thus be a little more,"" he said. The intake pipe will be constructed three to four km inside the sea, and will be connected to the desalination plant on the sea shore.

The BMC had shelved the desalination project in the past on account of the exorbitant cost of electricity. ""But now since we plan to use renewable energy to run the plant, the per-thousand kilolitre cost of treating sea water will be close to ₹42,"" said P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects). ""This is comparable with the cost of the water that currently comes from the city's seven reservoirs. Since we are doing renewables, we will also have a power purchase agreement. This too will reduce operation costs.""",2023-10-02T01:47:54Z
The Times of India,Goa banks on Netherlands' lessons to find solution to its sand erosion | Goa News - Times of India,Gauree Malkarnekar,"Panaji: As climate change and sea level rise might further increase the risk of sand erosion along Goa's coast in the coming years, the state is looking towards the Netherlands for a solution.

This month, a five-member delegation headed by environment minister Nilesh Cabral is travelling to the Netherlands to witness implementation of the sand motor technique along a beach in the country. The technique is believed to be a 'natural solution', which involves extracting large quantities of sand offshore and depositing it along the coast, in a protruding peninsula shape from the beach to prevent sand erosion.

""A team from the Netherlands has already visited Goa to carry out preliminary surveys, as part of this association. Now, a team of two grade-I scientists, environment director, secretary and I will visiting the site of the implementation of the technique in the Netherlands to understand how it works,"" Cabral told TOI on Saturday.

The sand motor technique is believed to help redistribute the sand along the coast through natural processes and act as a buffer against sea level rise and mitigate the impact of cyclones.

Cabral said that once the Goa committee returns, the team from Netherlands will pay a second visit to the coastal state and help shortlist the beach suitable for implementation of the sand motor technique as a pilot project.

""Scientists from the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO) and the National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR) based in Goa will be consulted before the beach is finalised for implementation. During our visit to the Netherlands, we will also be meeting their environment minister to understand the success of the implementation. The visit will also focus on learning about ocean cleaning methods. During our visit, we will be visiting an exhibition on this topic,"" said Cabral.

The sand motor method is said to help nourish a beach with quantities of sand over 20 years.

Netherlands carried out the first assessment of its pilot project on the Delfland Coast off South Holland in 2016 and found the sand motor technique to be a success.",2023-09-30T19:25:55Z

ERD is a technology used for drilling longer horizontal wells at a high inclination angle to reach underground oil and natural gas deposits.

The ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) provided the exemption on the condition that the ERD station should be set up at a minimum distance of 500 metres from the forest area and should be at least 1km away from the protected areas (PAs), corridors and wildlife sensitive areas.

The exemption considered for the ERD technology will not be applicable if the drilling area falls inside the PAs notified under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, and ESZs.

The Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, has prepared a standard operating procedure (SOP) outlining the precautionary measures to be followed while carrying out drilling beneath the forest area.

Green activists are sceptical though. Environmentalist and executive director of Conservation Action Trust (CAT) Debi Goenka says ""the ERD SOP and guidelines are full of holes (pun intended)"".

Goenka said, ""Firstly, the SOP is extremely general and it appears that regional guidelines will have to be prepared followed by comprehensive site-specific studies by the WII.""

Goenka said the prescriptions are ""vague and not practical"". ""Significant changes will have to be made to SOPs and drilling techniques based on different geological conditions even within the undefined regions,"" he said.

The activist said there is not a word about how the drilled soil would be disposed of. It is also not clear that if the drilling is to be carried out underground, why the proposed study should be limited to above-ground biodiversity.

The Times of India, Lift Bombay high court stay on post-facto green nod for large projects: Government to Supreme Court | India News - Times of India,Swati Deshpande,"MUMBAI: The central government recently petitioned Supreme Court to set aside an order of the Bombay high court granting a stay on permitting any post facto clearances to large projects in Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) areas that lack the mandatory prior green nod. The HC order that the Centre seeks to challenge was passed on May 7, 2021.

The Centre filed its special leave petition (SLP) over 400 days later, said NGO Vanashakti on whose PIL the HC had passed the stay order.

The PIL had challenged a February 19, 2021 office memorandum or ""OM"" issued by the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change, setting out a process to grant post facto (after the project has come up) CRZ clearance. The PIL said such post facto nod would undermine the law of needing prior CRZ clearances and will regularise such illegal constructions.

The central government, represented by Solicitor General of India Tushar Mehta, sought urgent listing of the petition before the apex court on Friday, citing ""the national importance of the matter.""

Centre said there is grave urgency in the matter as ""almost 500 projects of national importance have been unduly affected because of the stay."" It also said the ministry's ""OM neither seeks to nor dilutes the requirement of 'prior approval.'""

The SC is expected to hear the matter on Monday, tagged with a similar matter filed by GAIL (India) against an order of the NGT.

There is a common question of law, the Centre said, citing precedents that call on courts to be ""extremely reluctant to pass adverse interim orders"" or stay even delegated legislation or rules.

The SLP said there had not been any subsequent hearings before the high court for almost a year and the stay order was passed without even hearing its stand.

The object of the OM is to ""regulate and grant ex-post facto CRZ clearance"" to projects which had commenced without obtaining prior CRZ clearance, to bring under compliance in an expedient manner parties who were flouting the law. The OM's aim is to protect and improve the quality of coastal environment and ""abating coastal environmental pollution,"" the Centre said.

The MoEFCC said it received several requests from coastal state governments to consider CRZ clearances for ""permissible activities"" that commenced sans prior nod due to ""inadequate knowledge of regulatory regime and other factors."" To bring such projects under compliance with environmental laws at the earliest is essential, rather than leaving them unregulated and unchecked, it said.

The HC order of May 2021 had said prima facie the MoEFCC order ""diluted"" the rigours of the Environmental Act and also noted at the time the Centre said no clearances were yet granted.

Centre, in its plea, stated there is grave urgency in the matter as 'almost 500 projects of national importance have been unduly affected because of the stay by Bombay HC.",2023-09-24T00:04:15Z

The Times of India,Spanish Firm To Draw Up Aravali Zoo Safari Design In 3 Months | - Times of India,Ipsita Pati,"Gurgaon: The Haryana government has selected a Spanish company that will draw up the design for the 10,000-acre zoo safari planned in the Aravalis of Gurgaon and Nuh. The company -- Tagbin -- has been given three months to prepare the design which will be evaluated by the state government, ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) and Central Zoo Authority before the approval is given.

The zoo safari plan has drawn opposition from environmentalists, who believe it will destroy the pristine stretch of the Aravalis, among the few that the ranges are left with.

Last year, the Haryana government had selected two companies -- Tagbin and Aegis -- after an expression of interest was floated. The state's high-power works purchase committee later picked Tagbin.

""Tagbin, in association with The Logical Zoo that specialises in design and consultancy for zoos and aquariums, will be developing the design for the Aravali zoo safari. The firm designed the Sharjah Park safari too. We are hoping that our safari will be the best animal facility in the world,"" Haryana principal secretary (archaeology and museums) MD Sinha told TOI.

The zoo safari, if built according to the plan, will be the largest such project in the world. According to the proposal, it will have fenced off zones, including large enclosures for big cats, and other zones for amphibians and herbivores, besides a bird park and nature trails for trekkers.

At present, the Sharjah Park in UAE's Al Dhaid is the largest such zoo safari. The park is spread over around 2,000 acres and houses 120 species of animals.

""After the approval of the design plan, work on the first phase will be initiated. It will be the most unique animal safari facility in the world and help in wildlife conservation. Animals will have their own habitat,"" Sinha added.

According to the state's plan, the safari will be developed in three phases, of which phase 1 will be completed in two years.

The 10,000 acres earmarked for the safari are in a patch of the Aravalis that has degraded over the years. This land is protected under sections 4 and 5 of the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA).

In Gurgaon, the park will include PLPA areas in Sakatpur, Gairatpur Bas and Shikohpur and forest patches in Bhondsi, Ghamroj, Alipur, Tikli, Aklimpur, Naurangpur and Bar Gujjar. In adjoining Nuh, the safari will run into Kota Khandewla, Gangani, Mohamadpur Ahir, Kharak, Jalalpur, Bhango and Chalka.

The area earmarked for the safari is also part of the plan to facilitate compensatory afforestation in lieu of 26,000 acres of tropical forests that will be lost in Great Nicobar due to a mega infrastructure project by the central government. Compensatory afforestation to make up for this loss of forest in Nicobar was decided to be carried out in the Aravalis, around 2,400km away..",2023-09-15T02:56:36Z

The Times of India,"Reward for saving energy, penalise for wasting it: Physicist | Bengaluru News - Times of India","TNN, Updated Sep","BENGALURU: Can we innovate our way out of the climate crisis? Is there something we can do at a macro level that can accelerate those innovations towards a greener planet?

The Girish Karnad Annual Memorial NIF lecture threw light on these questions when physicist Amory Lovins - an American writer who is also known as the 'Einstein of Energy Efficiency' - interacted with Infosys chairman Nandan Nilekani on renewable energies and innovations that could help create a greener plant. The event was organised by the New India Foundation. Excerpts from the interaction:

Nilekani:

When it comes to innovations, what does the future look like?Lovins:

It will be a combination of innovative designs, technology, new business models and strategy, along with behavioural change.Nilekani:

Can public policy accelerate change? For instance a carbon tax or something?Lovins

:

One of the most effective ways to achieve such goals is through 'feebate.' A combination of fees and rebates. For example, when you buy an energy-efficient car, you get a rebate. If you buy a car which is less energy efficient, you pay a fee. This is commonly used in several European countries. In the property market also, people can be rewarded for saving energy and penalised for wasting it. Nilekani:

Sun and wind are volatile sources of energy. Solar energy can be used only when there is sun. Wind does not blow all the time. So do you need other sources of energy that are more stable?Lovins:

The wind is not still at night at all places. The energy sources are usually complementary during day and night. You can use other renewables along with these. You run renewables whenever they are available because they cost nothing to run.Nilekani:

I get a sense that you don't think we need grid storage because millions of car batteries will do the job.Lovins:

There may be cases where you need grid storage. In places like South Australia, they have giant batteries that charge with cheap power or negative power.",2023-09-12T02:39:11Z

Hindustan Times,"No schools in afternoon, painting rooftops white: Delhi gets its first heat action plan",,"The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), which prepared the plan and submitted it to the Centre last month, also plans a pilot project to paint roofs in identified areas with white colour to help keep the indoors cooler.

""The DDMA started working on Delhi's first heat action plan in September last year after Lieutenant Governor V K Saxena convened a meeting in this regard. The National Institute of Disaster Management vetted it and provided suggestions,"" a DDMA official told PTI.

The heat action plan (HAP), which has now been sent to the National Disaster Management Authority, will be updated on an annual basis and the Sub-Divisional Magistrate at DDMA will act as the nodal officer for its implementation, the official added.

Delhi is one of the hottest cities in India and ranks among the most susceptible to heat waves due to its large population and a significant concentration of lower-income groups.

Heat waves are becoming more intense and frequent due to climate change. India reported 706 heatwave incidents from 1971-2019 which claimed more than 17,000 lives, according to a paper authored by M Rajeevan, former secretary of the Ministry of Earth Sciences, along with scientists Kamaljit Ray, S S Ray, R K Giri and A P Dimri.

A study by the Indian Institute of Technology-Gandhinagar says India could witness a staggering 30-fold increase in severe heat waves by 2100. A 75-fold rise is predicted under a business-as-usual scenario.

The Delhi HAP relies on heat wave forecasts from the India Meteorological Department for the next seven days for issuing colour-coded alerts to the local population.

A 'red alert' will be triggered when the maximum temperature exceeds the normal temperature by at least 6 degrees Celsius. An 'orange alert' will be issued if the maximum temperature is four to five degrees Celsius above normal, while a 'yellow alert' will be given for a departure from normal ranging from 0 to 3.9 degrees Celsius.

Based on land surface temperature maps, the plan lists 10 wards -- Harkesh Nagar 092s, Harkesh Nagar 092s, Khyala 008s, Wazirpur 072n, Bijwasan 048s, Vishwas Nagar 017e, Hari Nagar A 010s, Jahangirpuri 021n, Delhi Gate 088n and Shastri Park 025e -- as thermal hotspots in the capital, emphasising the importance of rapidly equipping them with amenities to cope with extreme heat.

The heat action plan will be implemented in three phases: Phase 1 (pre-heat season -- February and March) is dedicated to developing early warning systems and a communication plan for issuing alerts to the general public, healthcare professionals, and voluntary groups (caregivers). The focus is on training and capacity-building for these groups.

In Phase 2 (March to July), ""cooling centres"", including temples, public buildings, malls, and temporary night shelters, will be activated to offer outdoor workers, slum communities, and other vulnerable populations access to shaded areas in response to heat alerts.

Non-essential water uses will be suspended in case of water shortages. Access to potable water will be expanded to religious places, and bus transit stations, and water pouches will be provided in poor and high-risk areas, the plan states.

The education department will have to ensure that ""schools do not function during peak hours (12 noon to 4 pm)"" when a heatwave is declared.

According to official estimates, around 2 crore residents of the national capital need approximately 1,300 MGD of water for consumption and daily needs. But the Delhi Jal Board can supply only around 1,000 MGD, leaving many areas grappling with water shortage.

The Delhi HAP recommends creating water points and providing oral rehydration solution (ORS) at construction sites, bus stops, and other public places, especially during events like rallies in the summer. Water tankers will be made accessible in slum areas upon request during days with an orange or red heat alert, it says.

Uninterrupted power supply to critical facilities such as hospitals and health centres will be given priority, the night shelters will remain open throughout the day, and large LED display boards will be installed at key locations to share temperature forecasts with the general public.

The nodal officer will hold regular meetings to monitor developments during a heat alert.

Under Phase 3, which will be implemented in the July-September period, cool resting centres will be established in high-risk areas and tree plantation will be undertaken in heat hotspots.

The nodal officer will evaluate the reach and impact of the plan and revise it accordingly. The revised plan will be uploaded on the Delhi government's website ahead of the next heat season for stakeholders' feedback and opinion.

As part of a trial project, roofs will be painted with white colour to help keep the surface cooler. Cool roof paints reflect a significant amount of sunlight away, preventing the roof from getting as hot as it would with regular paint.

Many cities in India, for instance, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad, have adopted cool roof strategies because of their simplicity and low cost. Depending on the setting, cool roofs can help reduce indoor temperatures by 2 to 5 degrees Celsius as compared to traditional roofs.

The Delhi HAP states that the cool roof programme needs to be targeted towards the most vulnerable settlements with poor-quality homes that trap heat and become dangerously hot.

""People living in slums and low-income communities are particularly vulnerable to heat. A large percentage of their homes are far from being optimal. As a future recommendation for addressing extreme heat in Delhi, households in wards that rank high on the risk score can be selected based on factors such as the household's electricity bill, having a tin roof, direct sunlight exposure, and the number of household members sharing the space,"" the plan reads.

The action plan also recommends distributing gunny bags, which have a natural ability to absorb heat, for use on tin roofs or asbestos in slum areas.

It calls for diligent monitoring of heat-related illnesses and fatalities at hospitals and health centres, underling that such reports provide insights into the impacts of heat, regardless of current weather conditions.

Avinash Kumar Chanchal, Campaign Manager, Greenpeace India, said it is heartening to see that Delhi has finally got a heat action plan after a long wait.

""This plan recognises the vulnerability of slum dwellers, outdoor workers, women, and senior citizens to heatwaves. However, there is a need for a more comprehensive vulnerability assessment at the ward level and specific recommendations to attend to the most vulnerable communities. The plan should include specific and time-bound targets to establish cooling centres, and provide ward-level healthcare facilities and essential services for these communities,"" he said.

While the plan talks about long-term infrastructural improvements such as the provision of bus shelters and cooling centres for low-income groups, Chanchal said it does not spell out how the funds would be mobilised to execute these measures.

He also stressed the need to establish a coherent legal framework to hold relevant authorities accountable for the implementation of the plan. This could include mandates, guidelines, and penalties for non-compliance.

The DDMA official told PTI that the departments concerned will have to spend money from their coffers to build the critical infrastructure needed to combat heat waves.

The groups vulnerable to extreme heat according to the plan include young children, pregnant women, lactating mothers, individuals aged 60 and above, families living below the poverty line with inadequate housing, infirm and isolated individuals, those with pre-existing medical conditions or on specific medications, people with limited mobility or impaired thermoregulatory capacity, and individuals engaged in outdoor occupations.

According to the DDMA, the insufficient ability to manage extreme heat can be attributed to several factors, including a lack of awareness about necessary precautionary measures, as well as unfamiliarity with the symptoms of heat-related illnesses and the immediate treatments required.

Inadequate connectivity to Primary Health Centres (PHCs) and limited access to urgent medical assistance at the local level, especially in rural areas, further contribute to the challenge.

The absence of shaded areas and cooling facilities, coupled with insufficient access to an adequate water supply, exacerbates the issue. Additionally, a lack of knowledge about available services compounds these challenges.",2023-08-17T16:11:12Z

The Hindu,PM Modi's U.S. visit yields many vital agreements,,"India and the U.S. on Thursday announced a number of agreements on defence cooperation, critical and emerging technologies, health, environment, visas and space -- including a deal which could pave the way for an unprecedented transfer of jet engine technology -- as Prime Minister Narendra Modi met U.S. President Joseph Biden as part of his first state visit to the United States.

The two leaders, who hailed the strengthening of the strategic partnership with the visit, met at the White House and made the point that both countries share democratic values, while addressing a gathering of officials and thousands of members of the Indian-American diaspora community.

Mr. Modi and Mr. Biden marked what they have described as a new stage in the India-U.S. relationship as the Prime Minister was accorded a ceremonial welcome at the White House South Lawn by the President and First Lady Jill Biden on a drizzly Thursday morning.

Both leaders addressed a press conference after their bilateral meeting. Mr. Modi answered two questions -- one on democracy in India from the American press corps and another on climate change from the Indian media press corps.

Mr. Modi agreed with Mr. Biden that democracy was in the DNA of India and the U.S. ""Democracy runs in our veins,"" Mr. Modi said, maintaining that there was no discrimination in India.

The Prime Minister and the President discussed the war in Ukraine during their bilateral meeting.

""We are completely ready to contribute in any way we can to restore peace,"" Mr. Modi told the press conference.

The address on the South Lawn saw a number of people chanting ""Modi, Modi"", even as protesters met further away from the White House to demand that the U.S. President raise human rights issues with the PM.

More than 75 lawmakers had signed a letter urging Mr. Biden to express concerns over the situation in India ""publicly"", while a number of members of Congress announced on Thursday that they would ""boycott"" Mr. Modi's address to the joint session of the U.S. Congress.

Mr. Biden, who embraced Mr. Modi a number of times during the welcoming ceremony, had clearly set aside the protests. ""I've long believed that the relationship between the United States and India will be one of the defining relationships of the 21st century,"" he said.

Cabinet officials on both sides and a few thousand diaspora members, some of whom chanting ""Modi, Modi"" were in attendance.

It was not just pomp and ceremony though -- the two sides announced a long list of deliverables spanning defence, critical and emerging technology, health, energy and mobility. Mr. Biden characterised this as a ""next generation partnership"".

""After becoming the Prime Minister, I have come here many times, but today for the first time the doors of the White House have been opened for the Indian American community in such large numbers,"" Mr. Modi said.

Also palpable in Washington were concerns around Mr. Modi's past, when he was Chief Minister of Gujarat, as well as concerns about democratic backsliding in India. Former President Barack Obama, who is a close friend of Mr. Biden, also weighed in, appealing to Mr. Modi to protect ethnic minorities in India.

""I came to the U.S. as an ordinary citizen and I saw the White House from outside. As Prime Minister, I have come here many times, but have never seen the White House doors opened for so many Indian-Americans,"" said Mr. Modi, who has previously visited the U.S. five times as Prime Minister. The last Indian leader to be accorded a State visit was Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in 2009, who had also addressed Indian-American crowds on the South Lawn during a 2005 visit.

'We the people'

""... As democracies, we can better tap into the full talent of all of our people and attract investments ... with our ...greatest export being the power of our example: equity under the law, freedom of expression, religious, pluralism and diversity of our people,"" Mr. Biden said in his welcome speech on the South Lawn. Both leaders referred to the countries' Constitutions beginning with the phrase ""We the people"".

""Both of our countries take pride in their diversity. Both of us believe in the fundamental principle of in the interest of all for the welfare of all,"" Mr. Modi said as per a translated version of his speech. ""Our strong strategic partnership is a clear proof of the power of democracy,"" he added.

""The decisions we make today are going to determine our future for decades to come,"" Mr. Biden added.

Earlier in the day, General Electric and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited announced they had signed a big-ticket MoU to jointly produce GE 414 jet engines in India for the Tejas Mk2 light combat aircraft. U.S. officials who briefed journalists before the announcement appeared to be patting themselves on the back for the deal, with one official describing the Indian side as being ""surprised and thrilled by the steps"" the American side has been able to take to overcome bureaucratic roadblocks to the deal. India's purchase of armed drones is also likely to be announced on Thursday.

The Defence Ministries of the two countries also launched the inaugural session of an innovation platform -- INDUS-X -- in Washington DC on June 21, hosted by the U.S. India Business Council, to foster defence industrial collaboration. Among the big private sector deals coinciding with the visit was U.S. semiconductor and chip maker Micron Technology, Inc's announcement that it would invest up to $825 million in a new chip assembly and test facility in Gujarat, which would be bolstered by investment from the Indian and Gujarat governments, totalling $2.75 billion.

In space cooperation, India is signing on to a framework of 25 countries for space exploration and cooperation. The two countries have agreed on a framework for human spaceflight this year, and a mission to the International Space Station in 2024.

After years of pandemic-induced visa slowdowns, the U.S. is announcing a pilot programme to renew visas domestically -- which means that applicants do not have to travel outside the U.S. to get their renewal stamps -- for certain petition-based temporary workers.

This programme could expand to cover H1B and L-1 skilled visas by 2024 and to other categories eventually. It will also involve opening U.S. consulates in Bengaluru and Ahmedabad. India will reopen its consulate in Seattle, and announce new consulates elsewhere in the U.S.

The Times of India,Mrpl Phase Iv Expansion Will Gain Pace Once Land Issues Are Solved: Md | - Times of India,"TNN, Jun","Mangaluru: MRPL managing director (additional charge) Sanjay Varma said that the CPSE Miniratna is studying the reconfiguration for MRPL's fourth phase of expansion. However, the expansion works will gain pace, with huge investment, once the state government hands over about 800 acres for the project. He told reporters on Wednesday, that MRPL had made some plans for expansion, but they are having a re-look at it, as those plans were drawn up before the Covid-19 pandemic.

""The business environment is fast changing because of climate change and e-vehicles coming in. We are looking into what kind of process units or products we can make, which can make our company contribute towards import substitution. Petrochemicals and pharma intermediates are imported from foreign countries, especially from China. Since the refinery has a molecule which can make a pharmaceutical intermediate, we are trying to study the configuration, and looking into the demand and import substitution,"" he said.

However, Verma said that at this point in time they are a bit constrained, because of the non-availability of land. ""A number of litigations are in the Supreme Court that has held up the acquisition process. The moment the land issue is resolved, the phase IV expansion will be expedited,"" said Varma.

Meanwhile, MRPL has in-principle agreed to establish a green belt on 27 acres in Jokatte, and the works will start once the land is made available.

Recruitment process on

Varma clarified that the process of recruitment for 50 posts in the non-management cadre at MRPL is being held as per the norms laid down by the government.

Soon after MRPL opened its portal for online submission of applications for the 50 posts, the Congress and DYFI demanded to stop this recruitment process, stating that it has no provision to provide compensatory employment to 450 families who lost their land for MRPL expansion. Acting swiftly, Dakshina Kannada MP Nalin Kumar Kateel and Mooddbidri MLA Umanth Kotian held a meeting with MRPL officials.

Varma said that the present rules allow people from across the country to apply for the job. He said 66% of their employees on permanent rolls and 89% of the secondary workforce are from Karnataka. More locals are likely to join MRPL in the coming days, as the board has given directions to hold campus recruitment drives in NITK and MAHE.",2023-06-15T03:25:00Z
The Times of India,Gyan Bhawan: 'comprehensive Policy Soon To Minimise Pollution In State' | Patna News - Times of India,"TNN, Updated Jun 6","PATNA: The Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) organized an event at Gyan Bhawan here on the occasion of World Environment Day on Monday.

State environment, forest and climate change minister Tej Pratap and Arvind Kumar Choudhary, principal secretary of the department, were the chief guest and special guest of the event, respectively.

Various state level activities, including essay writing (for classes VI to X), painting (for classes I to X), quiz competition (for classes VI to XII), and a cycle rally were organised in May this year to promote environment protection.

The final round of the quiz competition was held at Gyan Bhawan on Monday. The winners were awarded prizes at the event.

""All efforts are being made for the conservation and promotion of the environment in the state. People's cooperation is needed to take the mission to the next level,"" Tej Pratap said.

He urged the audience to plant at least one sapling and avoid single-use plastic.

""The state government is actively working on technological changes to reduce their impact on the environment. In the next few months, the Bihar government will develop a comprehensive policy to minimise pollution in the state over the next 30-40 years. We must adopt an environmentally-friendly lifestyle. The environment will be saved in the hands of the children of today,"" Arvind said.

BSPCB chairman D K Shukla said, ""The state government has imposed a complete ban on single-use plastic. Efforts should be made to make up for groundwater harvesting, which has decreased in the 143 blocks of the state.""

The Times of India,Ngt Cancels Ec For Project On Technopark Phase-iii Campus | Thiruvananthapuram News - Times of India,Aswin J Kumar,"Thiruvananthapuram: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has cancelled the environmental clearance (EC) issued for the expansion of the mixed land use (master plan) project by Dragonstone Realty Private Limited on Technopark phase III campus (non-SEZ plot) and slapped a penalty of Rs 15 crore on the project proponent for having split the project as main and expansion projects.

The judgement was delivered by Justice Pushpa Sathyanarayana, judicial member, NGT, Southern Zone, Chennai, in the appeal filed by environmentalist Thomas Lawrence against the issuance of the EC for the proposed expansion of mixed land use project.

The total project cost is Rs 800 crore and the state environment impact assessment authority (SEIAA) had issued the EC in March 2021.

The mixed land use building construction project is on 3.937 hectares, with 2,71,164.4sq.m built up area. The approved built up area is 1,33,491sq.m with additional built up area of 1,37,673.4sq.m.

NGT has set aside the EC citing that grant of environmental clearance by ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF&CC) for main phase - III and grant of environmental clearance by state environment impact assessment authority for expansion of phase III amounts to splitting of project and such an action was violation of the dictum of the SC verdict in another case dated 2020.

While imposing a penalty of Rs 15 crore on the project proponent, the NGT ordered that the penalty levied should be paid to the integrated regional office, MoEF&CC within three months, which will be utilized for improvements of the wetlands in the district.

It has also been ordered not to undertake any further work under the expansion project of phase-III without obtaining EC.

NGT has also recommended to the ministry of environment, forest and climate change to take appropriate action against the authorities who were responsible in granting the environmental clearance for the phase-III project.

The SEIAA, Kerala, which should have considered the project comprehensively and having treated the phase-III as an expansion without application of mind is also liable for its conduct, the verdict noted.

NGT also directed state environment impact assessment authority to examine the proposal afresh and ensure that the project proponent conducts a cumulative impact study for the entire phase-III with a built up area of 2,71,164.4sq.m - a cumulative impact assessment for the entire project and also identify the mitigation measures that may have to be in place in phase - III project area where construction is already completed to ensure that adverse environmental impacts, if any, due to construction of main project of phase - III are remediated.

The state government had earlier rejected the contention filed by Thomas Lawrence challenging the conversion of land for the development of phase - III Technopark campus and alleging destruction of wetland for the purpose.",2023-05-31T03:01:00Z
Hindustan Times,A billion new air conditioners will save lives but cook the planet,,"Summer in India has always been hot. Increasingly, it's testing the limits of human survival. As temperatures have climbed across the world's most populous nation in recent weeks, more than a dozen people died at an event in central India and thousands crowded hospitals with heatstroke symptoms.

Hundreds of schools were closed and the mercury is still rising: Temperatures will hover around 45C (113F) across the northern plains this weekend.

The most immediate fix is mercifully affordable, at least in the short-term. Demand for air conditioners is surging in markets where both incomes and temperatures are rising, populous places like India, China, Indonesia and the Philippines.

By one estimate, the world will add 1 billion ACs before the end of the decade. The market is projected to nearly double before 2040. That's good for measures of public health and economic productivity; it's unquestionably bad for the climate, and a global agreement to phase out the most harmful coolants could keep the appliances out of reach of many of the people who need them most.

The logic behind the AC boom is simple. Economists note a spike in sales when annual household incomes near $10,000, a tipping point many of the world's hottest places touched recently or will soon. The Philippines passed the $10,000 threshold roughly last year; Indonesia within the last decade. In India, where more than 80% of the population doesn't yet have access to air conditioning, per capita gross domestic product -- adjusted for purchasing power -- will top $9,000 this year for the first time.

""We are operating in a limitless opportunity,"" said Kanwaljeet Jawa, who heads the India wing of Daikin Industries Ltd, the world's largest AC manufacturer. In recent years, he said, ""our sales have grown more than 15 times.""

Read | All eyes on monsoon as cooler summer delays crucial pattern

This development has far-reaching consequences for public health, wellbeing and economic growth. Purchasing an AC is a pivot away from poverty for individuals and for their communities. People in hotter countries, which also tend to be poorer ones, suffer from worse sleep and impaired cognitive performance, both of which drag on productivity and output.

In a study looking at thousands of Indian factories with different cooling arrangements, researchers found that productivity fell by around 2% for every degree Celsius increase. This is a big deal for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's push to boost sluggish export numbers, lure business from China and move up the global value chain: The declines due to heat over the past 30 years may equate to roughly 1% of India's GDP, or about $32 billion, according to E. Somanathan, author of the report and a professor of economics at ISI Delhi.

But expanding AC coverage too quickly also threatens to worsen the crisis it's responding to. Most units use a refrigerant that's far more damaging than carbon dioxide. The nations where demand is growing fastest remain deeply reliant on coal-fired power, and most people can only afford the cheapest, most energy-inefficient units.

Read: World Meteorological Organization warns of likely spike in temperatures globally

If efficiency standards don't improve, ""then the planet will literally be cooked,"" said Abhas Jha, a World Bank expert on climate change based in Singapore.

Wealthier, more temperate countries have tightened regulations on ACs, requiring better energy efficiency and less-toxic coolants. That adds to the cost of units, making those kinds of measures less palatable where affordability is paramount. International climate bodies are pressuring developing countries to lower their carbon footprint, but India and its peers point out that they still contribute far less to global emissions than places like the US, where nine out of ten people have access to AC.

""We're facing a situation where extraordinarily harsh conditions are being imposed on growing economies,"" said José Guillermo Cedeño Laurent, an assistant professor of public health at Rutgers University in New Jersey.

In Delhi's working-class neighborhoods, these debates are abstractions. For many, access to an AC is a matter of survival. Piyu Haldar, who works as a maid, said her shanty turns into a furnace in the summer. The tin roof gets hot enough to cook roti on it. Before sleeping, Haldar and her husband used to splash water on their bed to cool down the room.

When her son was born in 2016, he suffered fevers from the heat. That was the breaking point. To afford an entry-level Voltas AC, Haldar stopped buying clothing, cut down on meals, took out a loan and doubled the number of houses she cleaned.

Haldar, 27, avoids turning on the unit during the day. But as night falls, she flips on the switch and closes the door, keeping the mosquitoes out and preserving the cool air. In a windowless bedroom decorated with teddy bears and toys, her son, Yasir, pushed his face against the AC, delighting in the ""cold chilled air!""

""Relatives visit just to sit next to it,"" Haldar said. ""People think we've become very fancy."" Since purchasing the AC, she and her husband have more energy in the day, she said, and Yasir no longer falls sick from the heat.

As more people like Haldar buy ACs, cooling companies are trying to improve energy efficiency without pricing out their biggest growth markets. Most G-20 nations, including India, use labeling systems to rate the efficiency of products, and stricter standards in the US and European Union have lowered energy use from appliances by 15% in recent years, according to BloombergNEF.

Haldar chose a three-star unit from Voltas, which cost about 27,000 rupees ($330), or roughly 15% less than comparable higher efficiency options. Three-star units comprise about 60% of total AC sales at Godrej Appliances, one of India's largest retailers, said business head Kamal Nandi. One way to encourage consumers to buy more efficient models, the company says, would be to lower taxes on the units to 18%, down from the 28% luxury tariff that currently applies. ""The AC has become a necessity,"" Nandi said. ""It is no longer a luxury item.""

For cooling companies like Daikin and Haier, the growing demand for ACs could be quashed by regulation designed to slow climate change. Part of the problem will be solved if and when countries move toward cleaner sources of power. The other issue -- the refrigerants that turn that electricity into cool air -- is trickier.

One of the most common coolants, hydrofluorocarbons, can have 1,000 times the warming potency of carbon dioxide. Scientists estimate that failing to drastically lower dependence on HFCs could result in half a degree Celsius of warming by the end of the century, an enormous contribution to a rise that would trigger deadlier storms, droughts and, yes, more heatwaves.

In 2016, more than 170 nations agreed to start phasing out HFCs beginning in 2019, with wealthy industrial countries required to make the first deep cuts. There are less environmentally harmful coolants on the market, made by Chemours Co. and Honeywell International Inc. Daikin and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation are working on their own products.

""If you don't have a green refrigerant, you are going to be the loser,"" said Jawa, the chief executive of Daikin India, which became a billion-dollar company last financial year and expects to double that number within three more.

Cooling companies are hunting for new options. Daikin's R-32 has approximately one-third the global warming potential of conventional refrigerants and is cheaper than some other coolants; it's become common in appliances sold by big retailers such as Godrej. But it's also a bit more flammable than older refrigerants and, according to Prima Madan, an expert on cooling and energy efficiency at the US-based Natural Resources Defense Council, still too polluting.

The Kigali Amendment to phase out HFCs is legally binding, and though many of its goals are still far in the future, developed nations have picked up the pace. While R-32 has ""helped avoid a large chunk of emissions,"" Madan said, ""we do need to go lower.""

As of now, though, the alternatives are often more expensive. That's prompted opposition even in wealthy countries. The US senate recently agreed to reduce HFC consumption by 85% within 15 years, and the conservative Heritage Foundation has warned Americans to get ""ready to pay a lot more for air conditioning.""

For India, the challenge is to implement cleaner technology before millions of new consumers purchase the dirtier ACs, locking in their use for another decade. Last year, the country logged some of its hottest weeks since 1901. Brutal heatwaves pushed temperatures to 50C (122F) on the subcontinent. The worst stretches killed hundreds of people, led to hours-long power outages and even caused a giant landfill on the outskirts of India's capital to spontaneously combust.

Naresh Tatavet, a personal driver in Delhi, is among those who've had enough. This month, he bought his young family their first AC, calling it one of the biggest financial investments he's ever made -- on par with purchasing a motorbike. In his neighborhood, after somebody purchases an AC, ""we bring them sweets to celebrate.""

Whatever happens in Washington, Brussels and other faraway places, Tatavet is sure of one thing: His family won't go back. He can no longer watch his baby throw up from the heat.

""I don't want to wake up drenched in sweat anymore,"" he said.",2023-05-17T11:20:00Z

The development is being hailed as a historic moment in the government's efforts for conservation of these endangered birds, reports Vimal Bhatia.

""Happy to share Project Great Indian Bustard has crossed another milestone in Jaisalmer. GIB, a highly endangered bird, also known as Son Chiriya, has been successfully hatched artificially. The chick was born from an egg laid by a 3-year-old female,"" Union minister for environment, forests and climate change Bhupendra Yadav tweeted.

Project GIB scientist of Wildlife Institute of India (WII) Dr Suthirtho Dutta confirmed that a GIB chick was hatched through captive breeding.

'Captive GIB breeding project crossed another milestone'

The Sam centre is one of two conservation and breeding centres in Jaisalmer to save the GIBs from extinction.

These centres are run by WWI in close collaboration with the forest department of Rajasthan, the ministry of environment, forest and climate change, and International Fund for Houbara Conservation (IFHC) with funding from the National CAMPA.

""With this, the captive breeding project for GIBs in Jaisalmer has crossed another important milestone,"" said Dr Dutta.

At the centres, female GIBs have been fitted with transmitters to locate nests, and eggs are being collected from the wild. A team of scientists, vets and technicians from WII, with the help of IFHC experts, artificially hatched and reared chicks from these eggs. Tagged GIB females re-laid eggs 3-4 times a year, helping create a captive population without impacting the wild population.

""GIBs start breeding at 3-4 years of age. A captive female that hatched at the Sam centre from a wild collected egg in March 2020 at the onset of the national Covid lockdown, and hence named Corona, mated with a captive male, which was also rescued as an egg when its mother was fatally injured during nesting by a Bonelli's Eagle in Ramdevra in June 2020. The egg resulting from their natural mating was artificially incubated for 23 days by technicians at the Sam centre and hatched successfully.

The NGT directed the MoEFCC to complete fresh appraisal for EC and take decision within three months. ""Till such decision, ECs will remain suspended,"" a four-member bench of NGT headed by Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel, its chairman, ordered on March 20.

Noted environmental activist Prafulla Samantara and social activist Sarita Barpanda had filed separate appeals challenging the validity of the EC granted to the plant.

The EC granted in April 2022 was challenged mainly on the ground that appraisal conducted by the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) was procedurally as well as substantively erroneous and detrimental to the environment.

As water will be sourced from the river, which is source of water supply to the inhabitants, apart from adding pollution to the already polluted area, the steel plant project will result in reducing forest cover and affect flora, the petitioners contended.

After considering all aspects, the tribunal observed that the EAC recommendations were ""vitiated"" on several issues. Permissibility of sourcing water from Mahanadi when drinking water is scarce has not been duly evaluated. The project by Posco was abandoned and was adversely commented upon by this tribunal vide order dated 30.03.2012 which aspect has not been examined. ""Conditions stipulated in the EC granted to Posco will have to be considered, in case ECs are to be granted,"" the bench also specified.

Hindustan Times,Build a new global agency to push climate financing,,"India's G20 theme -- One Earth, One Family, One Future -- centre-stages today's two key challenges: The climate crisis and sustainable development. Financing will be a critical requirement for meeting the economy-wide climate and sustainability challenges. The developed world promised $100 billion in climate finance, but that has not materialised. Besides, the requirement today is much more. At the Glasgow climate meeting in 2021, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi called for $1 trillion from developed countries to finance their mitigation and adaptation measures.

The reality is that most financing needs of developing countries are unlikely to be met by developed countries and or multilateral institutions. Moreover, raising finances domestically in developing countries remains limited. So, it is vital that green financing for developing countries emerges as a risk-mitigated opportunity for financiers from the developed world.

India is an excellent example of the scale of climate financing required. Thanks to a massive governmental push in the last eight years, India's solar and wind projects attracted $66 billion in investment. Going forward, this is expected to reach $1.15 trillion in the next eight years to realise India's climate ambitions of 450 GW of renewables by 2030, infrastructure for transmission and storage, and the Green Hydrogen Mission. Out of a total required investment of $1.15 trillion, the debt requirement will be around $850 billion, and the equity requirement will be about $300 billion. The domestic debt markets will find it hard to realise these amounts. As a result, India will have to rely on foreign sources for 40%-60% of the debt requirement.

On a global scale, climate financing may not be a macroeconomic problem because a fair amount of funds is available in developed countries, whereas the requirements are growing exponentially in developing countries. Indeed, the estimated annual investment requirement of $4-5 trillion to reduce emissions in developing countries is significantly smaller than the global annual savings of over $22 trillion and the global Gross Domestic Product of $94 trillion.

Borrowers in developing countries can borrow foreign funds at a cheap rate but the key issue is that their landed cost is not competitive. There are many reasons for this, including liquidity and convertibility risks that can't be easily mitigated over a long period. The high costs of hedging (usage of financial instruments or market strategies to offset the risk of adverse price movements) and the absence of a long-term hedging market exposes projects to currency risks in the medium-to-long term. The problem is exacerbated if the money is borrowed in a currency other than the US dollar or Euro as it requires two-pronged hedging.

The need for help with the costs of foreign exchange hedging for developing countries is well recognised with some international mechanisms also in place. But these are generally restricted to only a limited number of currencies. The need is for an institutional way forward at the global level so that large-scale actions can significantly reduce premiums over and above the currency depreciation rate, making green projects funded by offshore financiers less risky and more cost competitive for both the lender and the borrower.

This can, perhaps best done through an International Foreign Exchange Agency for Climate Change, which could operate an international platform to lower the cost of foreign exchange hedging in developing countries for green projects. Such a global agency could encompass many currencies, allowing for the financing to be structured as a global pool wherein exposure in various currencies would provide a natural hedge.

The key questions relate to pricing and residual risks. The former would need to factor in pay-outs, including in the long run, but kept at a level that eases and facilitates flows to green projects in developing countries. Given geopolitical realities and global economic weightages, such an agency should be created as part of the Bretton Woods Institutions system (BWIs), linked to the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The United Nations and its agencies could also be roped in. The developed world will have a certain comfort with BWIs, given the history of their control over the institutions' governance structures. The developing world would have a say, and the agency would be able to leverage systems developed by them.

In 1944, the Indian delegation at the Bretton Woods Conference ensured that the mandate of the global financial institutions included development finance. This was, perhaps, the most significant global action to push the development agenda. As G20 president, New Delhi must consider laying the groundwork for an international institutional arrangement to help in climate financing and sustainability in developing countries. It would also be a lasting legacy of PM Modi, a recognised climate champion. Further, with Ajay Banga, the likely new head of the World Bank also showing interest in the climate, his appointment could institutionalise this arrangement.

Though the world appears to be divided, there also appears a certain willingness to work towards mitigating the great climate and sustainability challenges of the day. When the first summit-level G20 was convened in the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008-09, it used its leverage through the IMF to fix the global economy. It's time to do the same for the climate crisis and sustainability.

The Times of India,UBT neta's aide arrested in Dapoli resort case by ED | Mumbai News - Times of India,,"MUMBAI: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday arrested businessman Sadanand Kadam after four hours of questioning in a money laundering case against him and Uddhav Thackeray associate Anil Parab.

The ED's money laundering case is based on a complaint by the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change before the magistrate court at Dapoli in Ratnagiri last year. In the complaint, it was alleged that Parab, a Sena minister in the erstwhile MVA regime, and Kadam built a seaside resort at Dapoli, violating Environment (Protection) Act rules. Kadam is the brother of former minister Ramdas Kadam.

Parab, an MLC, has denied the charges saying he had already sold the land to Kadam and was not associated with it.

ED quizzes Parab's aide, arrests him saying he's not cooperating in probe

An ED team landed up in businessman Sadanand Kadam's native town Khed on Friday morning and searched his premises. On instructions from the officials, Kadam later turned up at the ED's office at Ballard Estate in south Mumbai. ED arrested Kadam around evening claiming he was not cooperating in the probe. The ED has questioned Kadam several times in the past. Last week, however, he failed to present himself before the agency's officers. Last year, the ED had recorded Parab's statement in the case. In January, the ED provisionally attached Sai Resort in Dapoli and the land it stands on; it is collectively worth Rs 10.2 crore.

The I-T department had also provisionally attached Sai Resort under the Prohibition of Benami Property Transaction Act in December last alleging that Parab is the beneficial owner of the resort and Kadam the front. ED alleged that Parab acquired illegal permission from the revenue department for construction of twin ground-plus-one bungalows on land falling under no-development zone and later, illegally built Sai Resort on ground-plus-two floors. The ED had also alleged that the payment for construction of the resort was deliberately made in cash. Construction commenced before registration of land in Parab's name - though payments were made and land was in his physical possession - to conceal the identity of the real owner of the building so that if expenses made for the construction and violations came to the fore, the onus could be shifted to Vibhas Sathe, the previous land owner.

In July 2017, Vibhas Sathe applied for conversion of land use from agricultural to residential-commercial before a sub-divisional officer in Dapoli. Sathe sold the land to Anil Parab for Rs 1 crore, it was alleged. The sale deed was allegedly executed in 2019. The sub-divisional officer granted permission to use the land for residential-commercial purposes, which was a violation of the CRZIII norms.

Hindustan Times,How Parijat Industries' new insecticide benefits farmers and climate,,"New Delhi, India - Rising temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns caused by climate change are leading to the emergence of new pests in agricultural fields. According to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), the warmer temperatures are allowing pests to survive and reproduce at faster rates. In response to the problem, the Indian government has launched several initiatives, which include providing access to new technologies and training programs that help farmers identify and control the pests.

In this context, Parijat Industries (India) Pvt. Ltd. Has came up with a very innovative insecticide that provides good control over several lepidopteran pests. This molecule owing to the state of art technology in its formulation has been granted patent by Government of India and is the first ever officially recommended Insecticide over Fall Armyworm of Maize. The name of this technical is VELEKTIN. VELEKTIN provides wide spectra of control on lepidopteran pests and in addition to Maize, it has label claim against lepidopteran pests in Cotton, Chilli and Soybean. VELEKTIN is a ""Made In India"" product with amazing results and has established itself as a PRIDE OF THE INDIAN FARMER.

Mr Uday Raj Anand (Director, Parijat Industries India Pvt Ltd) said ""we at Parijat Industries are committed to proactively responding to challenges facing Indian agriculture and have a dedicated R&D team working on cutting edge technologies to dynamically respond to farmer needs""

The ICAR is calling on the government to prioritize investments in research and development that will help farmers adapt to the changing climate and reduce the impact of new pests on crops. In conclusion, climate change is bringing new challenges and emergence of new pests is causing significant damage to crops and threatening food security.

The Times of India,17 shops in Jamshedpur penalised for flouting plastic rule | Jamshedpur News - Times of India,,"JAMSHEDPUR: The Jugsalai Municipal Council (JMC) has imposed a fine of Rs 10,900 on 17 shops this week for using banned plastic items. Surprise checking is being undertaken on a daily basis on the direction of SDM (Dhalbhum), Piyush Sinha.

According to the Plastic Waste Management (Amendment) rules of 2021, manufacture, stocking, distribution, import and sale of single-use plastic, including expanded polystyrene commodities are banned, said the SDM, in a press communique. Further, with effect from January 1, 2023, the government has banned polythene bags under 120 microns. The Union ministry of environment forest and climate change had earlier banned polythene bags under 75 microns in July 2022, but later it widened the limit to 120 microns.

Apart from seizing the banned items, the JMC officials also appealed to the traders and consumers to use biodegradable or compostable bags made of jute, cotton or paper for carrying items.

Eating food on thermocol plates is hazardous to health, would invite risk to lives, officials are explaining to the residents during their random visits for the search and seizure. The civic authorities have warned that along with the shopkeeper, users will also face action under relevant sections of the Plastic Waste Management (Amendment) rules and Jharkhand Municipal Act, if found guilty of flouting rules. A cloth merchant at Dukhu market in Jugsalai said requesting anonymity that no trader/shopkeeper is keen on keeping plastic carry bags, but customers insist them to do so. ""The jute and cotton carry bags are comparatively costlier hence several shopkeepers are reluctant to keep them,"" said the trader.

The Jamshedpur Thok Vastra Vikreta Sangh, president, Anil Modi, who is also the secretary of the Singhbhum Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said that the chamber in December 2022, approached the state government with request for relaxation in the curb rules.

Citing the orders of the environment and climate change department of the Maharashtra government, the SCCI body claimed that the said state amended the plastic and thermocol products (manufacture, use, sale, transport and storage) notification of 2018, whereby bags made of non-woven polypropylene not less than 60gm per square meter have been permitted since December, 2022.

Further, plastic sheets less than 50 microns, if used for packaging purpose by the industries, is permitted in Maharashtra.

""Till such time the cost effective sustainable alternative to the banned items is found, the state government should make some relaxation to revive the lives of the people enormously hit by the blanket ban on the plastic items,"" Anil said, referring to the letter addressed to the CM in December.

Notably, the Jugsalai market is popular for hosting both wholesale and retail shops.",2023-02-11T02:22:00Z
The Hindu,'India's G-20 presidency important to the world',,"Tamil Nadu Governor R.N. Ravi said here on Saturday that India was emerging as the voice of the voiceless in the international sphere and the world was looking towards India for guidance.

He was delivering the golden jubilee endowment lecture organised by the JSS Mutt to mark the 50 th year of JSS Mahavidyapeetha on the topic ""Leadership of G-20: Opportunities for Bharat.""

With reference to India assuming G-20 presidency, Mr. Ravi said India's leadership was equally important to the world as it is prestigious for the country. The concept of Whole World is a Family (Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam) is embedded in the DNA of Indians and the philosophy is guiding India's role in the world, said Mr. Ravi.

The Tamil Nadu Governor said India was being listened to in the present times with due respect and the world was turning its attention towards India for leadership. This at a time when the world was in turmoil due to crisis causes by climate change, global warming, the pandemic and economic meltdown.

Mr.Ravi attributed this development to able leadership within the country and the G-20 presidency was an opportunity for India to cement its ties with the rest of the world and showcase its culture,

India, Mr. Ravi said, believed in humanity and not in violence and hence opposed the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine. India has friendly ties with all countries and the stance India took during the war is ultimately benefiting the nation, he added.

Similarly, during the pandemic India not only developed a vaccine to combat COVID-19, but it was exported to nearly 120 countries and reflected the country's humanitarian nature and gesture. This, at a time when some countries and pharma companies were hoarding vaccines more than the requirement, he added.

He lauded the services of JSS Mutt and described Rajendra Swami, the previous pontiff, as a visionary. Mr. Ravi said the country was in dire situation at the time of independence and yet Sri Rajendra Swamiji was far sighted to establish an educational institution which has spanned to have 350 institutions under its umbrella and was rendering yeoman service to society.

Shivarathri Deshikendra Swamiji said that Sri Rajendra Swamiji laid the foundation for JSS Mahavidyapeetha to help the needy and serve the society. JSS Mahavidyapeetha Administrative Secretary and CEO C.G. Betsurmath and others were present.",2023-02-04T14:55:00Z

T Saminathan, chairman and managing director of the Kudremukh Iron Ore Company Limited (KIOCL), told reporters here on Friday, that the 388 hectares at Devadari in Sandur taluk of Ballari district, will be used for mining.

""The company had executed a mining lease deed on January 2, for a period of 50 years, for iron ore and manganese ore. The Union government had given its forest clearance for the mining activities, in its letter dated December 16, 2022. The mining in Devadari will be a lifeline to the company. After the closure of mining of iron ore at Kudremukh in 2006, the company is dependent on ore from Chhattisgarh mines, for its plant in Mangaluru,"" he said.

Prior to the commencement of mining, the work on approach road and other works will be taken up at Devadari, he said. ""In 2024-24, the KIOCL is planning to mine three lakh tonnes of ore. While it will be five lakh tonnes in 2025-26, the company has plans to reach one million tonnes in 2026-27, and reach its full capacity of two million tonnes in 2027-28. Based on the exploration report at Devadari, a detailed project report (DPR) will be prepared for a beneficiation and a pelletisation plant at Devadari,"" Saminathan said.

The production activities of the company were stopped temporarily, after the imposition of 45% export duty from May 22, 2022. With hefty export duty, it was not economically viable for the company to take up production, and the company had incurred a loss of Rs 146 crore, during the half year ended September 30. The withdrawal of the 45% export duty by the government of India, has significantly helped in the growth and progress of the company, he said, adding that the company had earmarked Rs 2.2 crore for various projects or activities in Dakshina Kannada, under its CSR activities.",2023-02-04T03:20:00Z

The MoEFCC has given powers to CETP operating agencies to take stringent actions against non-compliant member units in the draft rules. The draft rules even allow state pollution control boards to bring new professional management in case of repeated violations by CETP management.

A Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI) environment taskforce member said, ""The ministry has released draft rules, and we will send our suggestions soon. Some rules are already followed by CETPs here, and some are really encouraging. However, certain rules allowing state pollution control boards (SPCB) to remove CETP management is not acceptable.""

He said that as per the draft rules, the CETP operating agencies shall have the authority to access the member industry premises, without notice, to collect wastewater samples. The online continuous effluent monitoring system (OCEMS), if installed, shall also be accessible to the CETP operating agencies for cross-verification of the monitored values with the online data.

""The CETP operating agencies shall ensure that the member industries discharge their trade effluent meeting the outlet norms. In case of non-compliance with the norms and non-payment towards meeting operation and maintenance costs, the CETP operating agencies can refuse to take the effluent of defaulting members and cancel the membership.

The Hindu,NGO proposes development projects for Kochi ,,"Better Kochi Response Group (BKRG), a social collective of 25 prominent personalities of Kochi, has proposed projects for Kochi to be implemented mostly by availing corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds of prominent firms.

The projects include readying of 20 public toilets by modifying old containers, construction of small swimming pools at government-run schools, initiatives to address mosquito menace, floods, and climate-change hazards, more freego stand-up scooters for police patrol, BKRG president S. Gopakumar told reporters here on Tuesday.

BKRG had held discussions with the Kochi Corporation authorities recently on reviving and managing 45 existing toilets. An agency has been deputed to assess their condition. Public toilets made by modifying containers were readied on the collectorate premises, near Cochin Shipyard on MG Road, Jos Junction, and Park Avenue Road by utilising the CSR funds of Cochin Shipyard, Lions Club, and CREDAI.

Similar toilets have been envisaged on Queen's Walkway, Vyttila Junction, and a few other locales. ""The CSR funds for five toilets are already available. But we are not being allotted space to set them up. In addition, BKRG has engaged an agency to study the condition of 45 public toilets in the city,"" Mr. Gopakumar said.

The collective recently submitted a proposal to the authorities to import a mosquito type (male mosquitoes with wolbachia bacteria) from Singapore to neutralise mosquitoes that have been making life miserable for city residents, he said.

Swimming pools

The 'Swim for Life' project aims to build small swimming pools for government schools. The first such pool will be readied at the Government Higher Secondary School for Girls, Ernakulam.

A model footpath in the city having pedestrian-friendly street furniture and lights too is in the pipeline. BKRG is also in the process of starting a youth wing to motivate the youth for a better tomorrow. Members of the collective meet on the last Friday of every month to discuss issues affecting the city and come up with solutions, which are conveyed to the authorities and followed up on.

Hindustan Times,Virar-Dahanu railway expansion to commence in non-mangrove area,,"Mumbai: Despite receiving Stage 1 (in principle) forest clearance (FC) in February 2022, the Mumbai Railway Vikas Corporation's (MRVC) plans to enhance railway line capacity between Virar and Dahanu on the western line have not yet taken off, as the Bombay high court has not granted permission for clearing about 24.5 hectares of mangroves in Palghar district for the project. A writ petition before the HC is still pending in the matter.

However, the regional empowered committee (REC) of the ministry of environment, forests and climate change has allowed MRVC to start work on portions of the railway line that lie outside of the protected mangrove patches (about two hectares of land), while recommending the project for Stage II clearance, which is the final level of FC required for any project. With the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority having accorded the project CRZ clearance in November 2022, officials say that the HC's pending permission is all that stands in the way of the project's construction, slated for completion by 2025.

The project is part of Phase III of the Mumbai Urban Transport Project, and involves the laying of the third and fourth railway lines parallel to the existing double line corridor between Virar and Dahanu for a distance of about 63 km. ""As the existing double-line corridor is oversaturated, it is not possible to increase the number of suburban services in this section,"" an official from MRVC said.

""Therefore it was decided to lay an additional two lines to enable a separate corridor for suburban services, as has been done for the Churchgate-Virar section of the Western Railway,"" he added. ""The lines are being laid on the western side of the existing lines, as the Centre's dedicated freight corridor project is planned on the eastern side."" The proposed corridor will serve the requirement of roughly two million residents from Virar to Dahanu Road in Palghar district.

Official documents show that the project will lead to the felling of 25,438 trees, including 24,302 mangroves. To offset the loss, compensatory afforestation has been proposed on 54 hectares of degraded land in three nearby villages in Palghar itself. From the two-odd hectares of land outside the mangrove area -where work will be carried out without needing the HC's approval - a total of 200 trees will be transplanted within one year of receiving Stage II clearance. ""We will carry out the work in the monsoon season and send a report to the REC,"" said the official.",2023-01-09T19:14:00Z

""So, there are some things which must be cleared by the court...matter is sub-judice... but I assure you that we will file a review petition. We are able to convince the court about the genuineness, about the validity and about the ground situation, which is coming about the reading of the judgment,"" Yadav said.

The Centre should address the sentiments over environmentally-fragile areas as per Gadgil and Kasturirangan committees, said Yadav. ""The Union ministry has constituted a committee under the chairmanship of Sanjay Kumar. Many people, including church leaders, approached us about the issue. The committee will definitely consider representations by the people.""

Hindustan Times,Understand the import of SC's Aravalli ruling,,"In 1900, the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA) recognised that we need to conserve forests, for trees to prevent soil erosion, and save sub-soil water in the then Punjab hills. Last week, the Supreme Court (SC) held that areas in the Aravallis covered under the special section of PLPA have the features of a forest and should be conserved for their trees and soil quality. In the intervening 122 years, a lot has happened -- heatwaves, the climate crisis, illegal mining in the Aravallis, the rise of terminology such as ecosystem services (such as forests conserving soil and recharging groundwater) and simultaneously, a continuous effort by authorities to sign away the Aravallis for real estate or mining.

In its order, the SC has found that 317 square kilometres of land in Haryana, under Special orders (Section 4) of the PLPA, has the ""trappings of a forest"", and that Section 2 of the Forest Conservation Act will apply here. This means that these areas need to be conserved, and the Centre needs to be asked for permissions for any non-forest activities. The court has also directed the demolition of structures that have been put up without these permissions, and the restoration and afforestation of these areas.

The Aravallis are among the oldest mountain ranges in the world. Tigers live in Alwar and Sariska, leopards and hyenas between Asola, Faridabad, Gurgaon and Alwar. Dinosaurs once roamed here. For a forest-starved state such as Haryana, the forest cover of the Aravallis is a breath of fresh air, and a cup of cool water -- the hills work as a biodiverse carbon sink and water- recharge unit. You can feel the temperature dropping the moment you approach the Aravallis. Yet, this is also where the huge Bandhwari garbage landfill towers over the hills, and where deputy superintendent of police, Surender Singh, was mowed down by an illegal stone mining truck recently. In short, the Aravallis are being used for our worst impulses. Many more uses for the Aravallis are envisaged, but none of them include honouring the hill slopes and forests.

The draft Regional Plan 2041 for the National Capital Region (NCR) in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana is being finalised. There are glaring changes in the plan, in comparison to the last one. For one, all mention of the Aravallis has been removed. Eaten away bit by bit by apartment blocks, mines and restaurants, it appears that the most important, contiguous natural feature of the area doesn't deserve to even be named. Second, the target for forest cover of 10% in the NCR, as per the last plan, has been removed. Third, the existing Natural Conservation Zone (NCZ), that includes the Aravallis, has been changed to Natural Zone. The implication of this is clear: Natural zones may not be conserved. An existing cap on construction in the NCZ, as per the existing region plan, is that 0.5% of the land may be constructed. This has been removed from the new draft.

In 2017, Bharti Realty cut over 6,000 trees within the NCZ, without applying for permission under the provisions of Forest Conservation Act. This happened despite the fact that the area's forest status was to be decided, and a commitment to maintain status quo was given in the National Capital Region Planning Board in 2015. Later, the National Green Tribunal pulled up the firm and the Haryana government over the issue, but the. damage was done. Similarly, establishments such as marriage halls came up in the villages of Anangpur, Mewla Maharajpur and Ankhir, which the SC has ruled against.

In clarifying that an area not demarcated as ""forest land"" in revenue records can also be forest, the SC order shows us that features (and consequently, ecosystem services) of a site are important.

It is also significant that the fight for the Aravallis has been led by citizen groups such as the Aravalli Bachao Andolan, which do not want their last connections with nature severed. From birdwatchers and rock climbers to those who want the remaining forests to be restored for clean air, the hills represent a climate shield in the world's most polluted air.

Currently, the Aravallis in Delhi and Haryana, including spots such as Mangar, Aravalli Biodiversity Park, Bhondsi and Asola, have guests. The Indian paradise flycatcher (named for its beauty) and the Indian pitta (a bird with nine colours) have migrated from peninsular India to breed here. The resident Indian eagle owl is nesting in Aravalli's ancient slopes, while the Blue-cheeked bee-eater makes nests in slippery sandbanks. Such breeding spots are few, but marriage halls, restaurants and farmhouses dotting the hills are aplenty.

The vibrant life nestling in the Aravallis gives succour to those who believe it's not too late to save the remnants of NCR's Aravallis, especially since most of the hills are uninhabited by people.

The revised plan which is estimated to cost Rs 30 lakh has been approved by the state department of forests, environment and climate change but the funds are yet to be sanctioned.

Divisional forest officer (Dalma), Abhishek Kumar, said, ""According to our new plan, we have decided to add digital tools, including 3D audio visual facility, advanced simulation technology, touchscreen facility for the 'on-the-tip information to enable visitors to interact with the artefacts, to the NIC to make it an advanced information centre.""

He added, ""The idea is to provide a state-of-the-art centre to the visitors and nature lovers allowing them to collect information about the flora and fauna found in the sanctuary. It will also provide the visitors spend exciting time with their family and children.""

The two-storey NIC building will have a diorama on the ground floor and the information centre on the first floor.

Life-size dioramas of different animal species that are found in the sanctuary, popularly the elephant, besides red giant squirrel, sloth bear, barking deer and peacock, would add visual appeal to the exhibits. The display of flora and fauna on large screens would also provide educational and entertainment material to the visitors.

""It would be a virtual walkthrough of the sanctuary once a visitor enters the NIC building,"" Kumar said.

The official noted that the funds are likely to be sanctioned in the next few months.

The project work of NIC commenced earlier this year, but only the infrastructure part is completed at a net cost of Rs 10 lakh. The NIC is located at Makuklakocha village inside the sanctuary on an 80x100 square feet area.

Hindustan Times,ED raids properties linked to minister Anil Parab,,"Mumbai The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Thursday raided several properties in Mumbai, Pune and coastal Ratnagiri linked to Maharashtra transport and parliamentary affairs minister Anil Parab as part of a probe on alleged money-laundering and Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) violations in connection with a resort in coastal Ratnagiri that Parab purportedly owned.

The federal agency filed a fresh case against the minister and others under criminal sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and raided at least seven premises, including the 57-year-old Shiv Sena leader's private residence in Bandra, his official bungalow Ajinkyatara in Nariman Point, the Sai Resort and Sea Conch Beach Resort in Dapoli, Ratnagiri as well as the Pune residence of Vibhas Sathe, the man who allegedly sold the Dapoli land to Parab in 2017.

Parab, a three-time legislator in the Maharashtra legislative council, is the third minister of the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) to face a probe on alleged corruption by a Central agency, and several leaders including Shiv Sena party spokesperson Sanjay Raut and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar came out in his support and said the probe was a sign of the Centre's ""political vindictiveness"".

Parab said he had "" nothing to do"" with the Dapoli resort located in Ratnagiri district, a popular tourist destination.

""The Dapoli resort is owned by Sadanand Kadam. He has told the same to the court and even submitted details of all the expenditure (related to the resort) . This resort is not even opened for business but the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) lodged a case [against it] citing waste water was being released in the sea. The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board as well as local revenue and police departments have given reports that the resort is not functioning. [Despite that] a case was filed and this was used to raid me,"" he said after ED personnel left his official residence on questioning him.

""Today's probe was only related to the resort. I have answered all their questions and I am ready to respond if there are any further queries by the investigating agencies,"" he said.

He also said the ED did not confiscate anything from his house. ""I submitted certain documents to them...Truth will come out in the probe,"" he said.

Several Shiv Sena workers gathered outside the minister's official as well as personal residence in Mumbai to hold protest against the ED raids.

""The action by Central investigating agencies against Anil Parab and other leaders of our party are happening with political vindictiveness. The entire party and the government firmly stand behind Anil Parab. Such actions will not bring our morale down,"" Raut said.

Other charges of alleged irregularities and corruption are also understood to have formed the basis of the latest ED case. One pertains to allegations of the purchase of the Dapoli land by Parab sometime in 2017 for a consideration of ₹1 crore. It was registered in 2019. It is alleged that the land was subsequently sold to a Mumbai-based cable operator Sadanand Kadam in 2020 for a consideration of ₹1.10 crore. In between, a resort was built on the same land, but only the stamp duty was paid and the cost of construction was not accounted for, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) said after the Income Tax (IT) department conducted raids in March against some people allegedly close to Parab, including Kadam and deputy regional transport officer (RTO) Bajrang Kharmate.

The CBDT said in a statement in March that the construction of the resort started in 2017 and over ₹6 crore was spent in cash on construction of the resort. ""It transpires that the relevant facts about the construction of the resort were not intimated to the Registration authorities and accordingly, the stamp duty was paid only for the registration of the land on both the occasions i.e. in 2019 and in 2020."" The cost of construction of the same has not been accounted for either by the person searched (Kadam) or the politician (Parab) in their books of account, its statement added.

""We have no objection (against such action) if transparency is maintained. The agencies have all the rights but all we expect is they should not be misused,"" deputy chief minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Ajit Pawar said.

Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Kirit Somaiya said Parab's arrest was ""inevitable"".

""Anil Parab's imprisonment is inevitable as he has been involved in multiple criminal cases. Multiple state and central agencies including Maharashtra police, Central Bureau of Investigation, ED, National Investigation Agency (NIA) will have to investigate the crimes committed by him. He paid ₹25 crore in cash while constructing the resort in Konkan, forged the document for construction violating CRZ regulations, used corruption money for the transactions. The ED is investigating if the money used by the state minister was the same he received for police transfers in which the investigation has already been started by the CBI or [from] a scam in the transport department,"" he said.

Somaiya had visited Dapoli in March and accused Parab of not complying with an MoEFCC order issued earlier this year, which said that the Dapoli resort should be demolished for violations of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. Somaiya who was prevented from going to the resort by the local police said that he would ensure its demolition.

Somaiya referred to a prosecution complaint filed by an officer of the ministry on March 10 in the court of Judicial Magistrate (First Class) at Dapoli, seeking to prosecute Parab and Sai Resort and Sea Conch Resort.

Another case in which Parab has been under the radar of the ED and was questioned by the agency last September pertains to a money-laundering case connected to former home minister and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Anil Deshmukh.

Former police officer Sachin Vaze, arrested by the NIA in the case of recovery of an explosives-laden SUV near industrialist Mukesh Ambani's house in Mumbai, had levelled certain allegations against Parab.

In a statement recorded by the ED on June 19, 2021, Vaze claimed that an amount of ₹40 crore was collected from 10 deputy commissioners of police (DCPs) in Mumbai and paid to Deshmukh and Parab in connection with their transfer orders.

""I came to know that a total sum of ₹40 crore was collected from the police officers listed in the said order and out of which ₹20 crore each was given to Shri Anil Deshmukh, through Shri Sanjeev Palande, PS to home minister and Shri Anil Parab through one Shri Bajrang Karmate, RTO Officer,"" Vaze added.

Vaze further alleged in a letter that he sought to submit before a court, that in January 2021, Parab had asked him to carry out an inquiry against ""fraudulent"" contractors listed in the Mumbai civic body and ""collect"" at least ₹2 crore from about 50 such contractors.

Parab had categorically rejected Vaze's claims and said that he was ready to face any probe into the allegations.

""The Union government is deploying its agencies to topple the government. But our relationship is strong and we will complete our five-year term,"" said Yashomati Thakur, minister for women and child development and Congress leader, commenting on Thursday's raids.

The Times of India," Eye on China, Quad vows to stand together for free and open Indo-Pacific: Highlights | India News - Times of India",,"NEW DELHI: India, US, Australia and Japan -- the four nations of the ""Quad"" grouping -- vowed on Tuesday to stand together for a free and open Indo-Pacific region at the start of the second in-person meeting in Japan.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, US President Joe Biden, Japanese PM Fumio Kishida and Australia's Anthony Albenese held wide-ranging discussions with an eye on an increasingly assertive China which has been flexing its muscles in the Indo-Pacific region.

The leaders also vowed to work on fighting climate change and sought to pave over differences on issues involving Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Here's a look at the key highlights from the meeting ...

Quad ensured peace in Indo-Pacific: PM Modi

Highlighting that the Quad's scope has become extensive despite Covid-19 challenges, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the mutual trust and determination of the member countries is giving new energy and enthusiasm to democratic powers.

In his opening remarks at the summit, PM Modi said, ""Quad has made an important place for itself before the world in such a short span of time. Today, Quad's scope has become extensive, its form effective. Our mutual trust, and our determination is giving new energy and enthusiasm to democratic powers.""

The Prime Minister added that Quad is moving ahead with a constructive agenda for Indo-Pacific.

""At the Quad level, with our mutual cooperation, a free, open and inclusive Indo Pacific Region is getting encouraged - it is the shared goal of all of us,"" he added.

Russia on agenda

Besides talks of an inclusive Indo-Pacific, the Quad leades -- particularly President Biden -- focussed heavily on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which entered its fourth month today.

In his opening remarks at the summit, President Biden vowed that US will continue to work with its partners as long as Russia is waging war against Ukraine.

In strong remarks against Vladimir Putin, Biden said the Russian President is just trying to extinguish a culture in Ukraine.

Biden also warned that the global food crisis may worsen since Russia has blocked Ukraine from exporting its grains.

Stressing that Washington would stand with its ""close domestic partners"" to push for a free and open Indo-Pacific region, he said: ""Russia's assault of Ukraine only heightens the importance of those goals of fundamental principles of international order, territorial integrity and sovereignty.""

Meanwhile, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, in his opening remarks, said the Russian invasion of Ukraine represented a ""frontal challenge"" to the principles of the UN Charter and similar things should never be allowed to happen in the Indo-Pacific.

""A grave incident which has fundamentally shaken the rules-based international order has taken place since we met last September. The Russian invasion of Ukraine challenges the principles which are enshrined in the United Nations Charter. We should never ever allow a similar incident to happen in the Indo-Pacific region,"" PM Kishida said.

We mean business: Biden

Asserting that Quad is not just a temporary alliance, President Biden said that the four-nation group is hear to get things done.

""We share the same goal of ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific that will deliver greater prosperity and greater opportunity for all of our children. I am looking forward to continuing to work with all of you and to strengthen economic cooperation to deliver inclusive growth and shared prosperity,"" Biden said in his opening remarks.

""We've shown that Quad is not just a passing fad, we mean business. We're here to get things done for the region, and I'm proud of what we're building together and I look forward to our vital partnership flourishing and for many years to come,"" Biden said.

Biden also welcomed Prime Minister Modi at the summit and said ""it is wonderful to see you again in person"".

Albanese's first Quad summit

Attending his first Quad summit a day after assuming charge, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said his goals were aligned with the priorities of the Quad nations.

Albanese, the leader of Australia's Labor Party who was sworn in as his country's 31st prime minister, also said the Quad stood together for a ""free and open Indo-Pacific"".

He also told the fellow leaders that Australia wanted to discuss the issue of climate change.

On a lighter note, President Biden welcomed Albanese to his first Quad meeting and quipped about how the Australian leader had to rush for the summit immediately after being sworn-in.

""Like I said, you got on a plane -- you were sworn in and got on a plane. So if you fall asleep while you're here, it's OK, because I don't know how you're doing it. It's really quite extraordinary -- just getting off the campaign trail as well,"" Biden said.

What is Quad

Formally the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, the Quad began as a loose partnership after the devastating 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, when the four countries joined together to provide humanitarian and disaster assistance to the affected region.

It was formalized by former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in 2007, but then fell dormant for nearly a decade, particularly amid Australian concerns that its participation in the group would irritate China.

The group was resurrected in 2017, reflecting changing attitudes in the region toward China's growing influence.

Both the Trump and Biden administrations saw the Quad as key to a pivot toward placing more focus on the Indo-Pacific region, particularly as a counterweight to China's assertive actions. The Quad leaders held their first formal summit in 2021 and met again virtually in March.

The study on the socio-economic aspects on the impact of climate change carried out by MSU researchers has revealed that even lower middle class and middle class families have increasingly started purchasing and using ACs and coolers to stay cool during extreme heat.

The multi-disciplinary study was carried out by researchers from MSU's family and community sciences and social work departments covering 10,000 citizens.

Even the number of hours that ACs and coolers are being used to keep homes cool have increased, the study carried out by Profs Neerja Jaiswal and Magan Parmar as principal investigators and Dr Shilpi Saraswat and Dr Satish Bodla as co-principal investigators, states.

In terms of years of purchase, a majority of respondents purchased ACs and coolers after 2016.

If nearly 20% respondents had purchased ACs and coolers between 2007 and 2010 and nearly 7% others in the period between 2012-2015, as many as 72% of those surveyed purchased the electronic equipment between 2016 and 2019.

In terms of usage, a majority of those who have purchased ACs and coolers - 66.68% - run it for 7 to 10 hours a day, whereas there are equal number of people who run it either for 3 to 6 hours or 11 to 24 hours a day.",2022-03-25T01:34:00Z

The board members said there will be a lot of delay in processing the applications as it will have to be routed through the Collector, GSPCB, department of environment and climate change, etc.

GSPCB chairman Mahesh Patil asked the Confederation of Indian Industries (CII), Goa Chamber of Commerce and Industries and Travel and Tourism Association of Goa to make representation to the government over their grievances.

As per the notified noise rules, in case of events, functions, programmes involving more than 50 participants, the application shall be forwarded by the authority to GSPCB.

The Times of India,Goa coastal plan delayed again as national body rejects relaxations plea | Goa News - Times of India,,"Panaji: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) had set December 31, 2021, as the final extended deadline for Goa to complete its coastal zone management plan (CZMP). Two months after this deadline has expired, the finalisation of Goa's CZMP is set to be delayed even further.

The National Coastal Zone Management Authority (NCZMA) has turned down the state's request seeking some relaxations for Goa, and has also suggested some alternative changes to the coastal plan. Goa will now require further time to incorporate these changes in the CZMP

The Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority (GCZMA), for instance, had asked that port limits should not be depicted on the state's coastal plan. Instead of non-depiction, the national authority has now asked Goa to show major and minor ports in two different colours.

Goa had also asked that only important structures like sites of archaeological importance in and around CRZ areas be marked on the CZMP.

The secretary for the Union environment ministry told GCZMA to put up in writing which structures are to be shown and which are to be deleted from the CZMP. Goa has been advised to submit this data by March 15, 2022, to the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM).

Earlier, the Goa authority had decided not to depict any port limits on the state CZMP after protests from several citizens' groups. The port limits of all major and minor ports were depicted in a single colour on the plan, which led to citizens alleging that the Mormugao Port Trust limits are being extended to interior villages of Goa.

""The secretary, ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MOEF&CC) stated that the request for non-depiction of port limit on CZMP cannot be agreed upon. However, the major and minor ports can be depicted in different colour on the CZMP for identification,"" Goa was told at the meeting held on February 22 under the chairmanship of IAS officer Arun Kumar Mishra.

The GCZMA officials told the national authority that it had decided to seek the relaxation as port limits have not been depicted in the case of the states of Maharashtra, Kerala and Tamil Nadu on CZMP 2011.

""Both major and minor ports are depicted in a single colour, creating confusion in the mind of the general public, that all the areas depicted within the port limit are that of the major port. The area notified as major and minor ports is extensive in comparison to the total area of the state,"" the GCZMA told the national authority.

Also, the depiction of port limits is not a statutory requirement as per CRZ Notification 2011, the GCZMA said.

About marking of all structures on the coastal plan, the GCZMA said that Goa's revenue maps only depict structures up to 1974 and there is no record of structures between 1974 and 1991. It was felt that this would create a disparity and therefore it was decided to not depict all and any structures on the CZMP.

Now, as per the suggestion of the national authority, the GCZMA will be providing details to the NCSCM of only authorized structures on the seaward or river side to be depicted on the coastal plan. These structures will include sites of archeological importance, lighthouses, ramps, fishing jetties.

Hindustan Times,Bihar govt asks sellers to phase out single-use plastic products by June 30,,"PATNA: All e- Commerce companies, shopping centres, malls, cinema halls, tourist spots, hospitals, schools and colleges in Bihar have been asked to phase out the identified single-use plastic products before their sale and purchase termed illegal in the state.

In a notice issued by the Bihar State Pollution Control Board, a part of the department of forest, environment and climate change, the manufacturers, dealers, distributors and sellers of the single-use plastic products too have been directed to clear their stocks by June 30 as the production, sale and purchase of these products will be completely banned from July 1 this year.

In December 2021, the department had announced banning the sale and purchase of identified single-use plastic items in the state. The decision was taken following the directions made in August 2021 by the ministry of forests to all the states to phase out the use of identified single-use plastic items in their areas as there will be a nationwide ban on these products from July 2022. But the state forest department was requested by the manufacturers and traders to reconsider and revise its decision as they were not prepared to deal with the situation when these products will not be available.

Some of these identified single-use plastic items, which will be banned in July this year, include ear buds with plastic sticks, plastic bags, polystyrene or thermocol for decoration, plates, cups, glasses, cutlery such as forks, spoons, knives, straw, trays, wrapping or packing films around sweets boxes, invitation cards and cigarette packets, plastic or PVC banners less than 100 micron and plastic sticks for balloons.

""This is a reminder to the people dealing with single-use plastic items to get prepared for the ban. People should explore alternatives to avoid incontinence,"" Deepak Kumar Singh, principal secretary, department of forests, environment and climate change, said.

The ban on the identified single-use plastic items is important as it has been causing environmental problems, he added.

Kamal Nopani, CAIT (Confederation of All India Traders) Bihar chairman, said traders have started working on this line. ""People are trying to find out alternatives of the plastic items, which will be banned in the next few months,"" he said. ""In December 2021, the government asked traders to stop their sale and purchase. But, considering the season of weddings and ceremonies at that time and the high demand for plastic cutlery, traders had requested the government to give them some time to stop their sale and purchase,"" he said. This time no such relief is possible as these products will be banned throughout the country, he added.",2022-02-27T04:50:00Z

The EV Cell will comprise government officials, e-mobility experts, and industry stakeholders, and will work to accelerate EV uptake in Mumbai.

Speaking at the inauguration, which took place at state government's Sahyadri Guest House at Walkeshwar in Mumbai, Thackeray said, ""The state government is moving towards sustainable development by taking environment-friendly measures against the backdrop of climate change. In this connection, the state has announced its revised electric vehicle policy. Efforts are being made to increase the use of electric vehicles and Mumbai Electric Vehicle Cell has been set up as a part of these efforts. While emphasis was given to increasing the fleet of EVs in public transport, the government has decided to purchase electric vehicles. Now increasing infrastructure such as charging stations to promote use of EVs at the individual level is also a focal point.""

Taking to social media, Thackeray said, ""Today, we launched Mumbai EV Cell, a @mybmc & @WRIIndia partnership, to accelerate EV transition & adoption. With experts working towards sustainable mobility, this cell will assist in creating a network of charging stations, supporting battery development & market penetration.""

Hindustan Times,DDA struggles to provide land to compensate for the loss of trees,,"New Delhi: The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) is struggling to provide land for plantations to compensate for the loss of tree cover in the national capital caused by large-scale development projects, especially road infrastructure projects to decongest the city.

DDA officials said that the demand for land for compensatory afforestation (CA) from various infrastructure agencies has increased in the past year. The demand for CA has increased, as a large number of infrastructure projects require the diversion of ""deemed forest"" land.

While DDA is somehow able to carry out compensatory plantation on behalf of various agencies for their infrastructure projects under the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994, senior officials say that providing land for afforestation is a big problem.

Rajeev Kumar Tiwari, the principal commissioner, DDA, said, ""In the past year, we have received a lot of requests for compensatory afforestation. Providing land for afforestation is becoming increasingly difficult, as most of the green areas as per the master plan are already saturated.""

After providing 125 hectares of land for CA to various agencies last year, Tiwari said, ""We have requests from various agencies pending for 75 hectares of land. But we don't have much land available now.""

Deemed forests in most infra projects

As per The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, CA has to be carried out if forest or deemed forest land is diverted for an infrastructure project. The increase in demand for afforestation has added to DDA's worry, as clear land parcels have to be provided as per the Act.

According to the Delhi government's forest department, the deemed forests are identified as per the affidavit filed by the government's Conservator of Forest in the Supreme Court in 1997 in TN Godavarman vs Union of India & others (a case filed in 1995). As per that the deemed forest is identified as ""areas above 2.5 acres having a density of 100 trees per acre as well as stretches of land along roads, drains etc. having a length of 1.0 km besides areas shown as forests etc. in revenue records.""

As per this, in several new projects the area is being identified as deemed forest, said a senior forest department official. ""It is being done as per the norms,"" said the official.

But DDA officials cite paucity of land and say that the present vacant land parcels are reserved for the city's future requirements for public utilities.

""There is very limited vacant land available in Delhi. Delhi being a capital city is primarily an urbanised area. Most of the areas identified as recreational green under the Master Plan have already been used either as parks or for plantations. So, the availability of Master Plan green areas for the purpose of CA is now very limited. Other vacant land parcels in whatever limited quantities are available in Delhi need to be kept reserved for planning for public utilities,"" a senior DDA official said, requesting anonymity.

In May last year, the DDA wrote to the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change exploring if land for CA can be provided in neighbouring states for proposed central government projects in Delhi. The ministry's forest advisory committee (FAC) had asked Delhi authorities to provide additional information about their plan for the Capital's green cover.

""The FAC has been conscious that any relaxation in the compensatory afforestation norms will ultimately lead to a reduction in forest cover of Delhi which is not a desirable situation for residents of Delhi in the present and in the future,"" as per the minutes of the meeting issued in June 2021.

With land requests for 75 hectares pending, the DDA is planning to raise the issue of compensatory afforestation with the Centre for a solution, said a DDA official, requesting anonymity.

Compensatory plantation and transplantation concerns

It is not just CA, the DDA is facing problems in carrying out compensatory plantation as per the Delhi Preservation of Trees Act, 1994.

As per the Act, 10 saplings have to be planted for every tree that is cut. DDA officials say that this rule is posing a lot of problems in making land available for compensatory plantation. With the Delhi government notifying the tree transplantation policy in 2020, the DDA had written to the Delhi government to review the number of trees from 10 to 2.

DDA officials said that compensatory plantation for 85,000 trees has been approved and a request for another 85,000 is pending. ""Two years back, it was decided to include the requests for compensatory plantation in our annual plantation targets; we do the compensatory plantation for various agencies. We are doing CP in our parks and along the Yamuna river, but the floodplain has a capacity. High-density plantation is not advisable here. We had requested the Delhi government to review the rule, but no decision has been taken so far,"" said another senior DDA official, aware of the development.

When contacted, a senior environment department official said, ""The DDA had written to us about it. The matter was discussed but no decision has been taken.""

As for tree transplantation, the DDA has decided that it will not provide land for it. As per the government's tree transplantation policy, at least 80% of the trees have to be transplanted by the infrastructure agency.

Last year, the DDA received a request for around 60 hectares of land for tree transplantation from various agencies such as the National Highways Authority of India, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, Central Public Works Department, etc. ""No land has been provided for transplantation,"" said a DDA official.

Development vs environment

While infrastructure agencies claim that impact on projects due to delay in getting permission for tree cutting and getting land for it, environmentalists question the pace at which development/redevelopment work is being carried out in the city.

Vijay Dhasmana, ecologist and curator of Aravali Biodiversity Park, Gurugram, said, ""Land is a scarce resource and has a carrying capacity; it can hold that much population and greenery. There is a need for better planning, as there is no end to development. It is suicidal to say that you need to develop and therefore green cover has to be taken away or reduced. This is detrimental to the quality of life of people living in the city.""

Diwan Singh, a Delhi-based environmentalist, agrees and has been vocal against the pace at which development projects are being carried out at the cost of nature. ""Air pollution is a major problem. Despite this, we are continuously planning new road infrastructure projects, highways in the name of decongesting the city. Unfortunately, all this is only resulting in densification as new highways will result in new residential, commercial and industrial development along with it,"" he said.

Dhasmana and Singh both oppose the DDA's proposal to revise the 1:10 tree norm for compensatory plantation. He said, ""The rule should be based on the diameter of the tree's canopy and not the number of trees cut. Now there are enough tools available to calculate the canopy cover removed. Based on it 5 or 10 times the trees should be planted.""

But government infrastructure agencies say there is a need to review the norms and expedite the process to grant permission for tree cutting so that projects meant for decongesting the city can be completed on time.

A senior NHAI official, requesting anonymity, said, ""The road infrastructure projects will only benefit the city, which is currently facing a major air pollution problem, as it will decongest the city. But getting permission for tree cutting takes a lot of time which impacts the projects. We need land for CA and transplantation for two of our projects. The DDA has told us that they can't provide land for CA.""

For NHAI's Urban Extension Road-II project, the agency has sought 6.4 hectares of land to transplant around 4,000 trees. ""DDA is yet to provide the land,"" said an NHAI official.

Sabyasachi Das, former planning commissioner in charge at DDA, agrees with DDA officials and said, ""Providing land for compensatory afforestation and plantation is a big challenge. The land available right now is for future development of the city and those land parcels can't be given for plantation purposes.""",2022-02-07T11:45:00Z
The Times of India,'India has fabulous plant diversity  --  we venerate life-giving plants' - Times of India,,"India has tremendously rich plant diversity. We have two of the world's biodiversity hotspots in the Western Ghats and the eastern Himalayas. We also have the Eastern Ghats, the central Indian forests, the western Himalayas, deserts, wetlands and mangrove forests. With such diversity, each region has its own kinds of plants. Some studies estimate India holds 11% of the world's flora.

Plants thus have an incredibly special place in Indian culture. In the Biligiri Rangaswamy Tiger Reserve in Karnataka, the Soliga tribe has a 'dodda sampige mara', a huge champak tree. They believe this tree is 2,000 years old. Looking at the tree, you feel it is truly other-worldly.

YOUR MAJESTY: This enormous banyan tree in Bidaraguppe, Karnataka, has grown over 300 years from being a small plant to a veritable palace of greenery which now shelters multiple forms of life. Picture courtesy: Suri Venkatachalam via H. Nagendra

Closer home to where I live, there stands a very large banyan tree, replete with all the roots and plants that grow upon it. This tree, considered to be 300 years old, is so dear to the locals, they insisted a highway was adjusted to not damage the tree. Villagers have built a small temple within the tree. When you walk inside this tree, with all its chambers and hollows, you feel like you've stepped into a magical place. Indigenous communities in Africa, North and South America also hold certain plants to be sacred -- lifegiving plants specifically, like the ficus tree which gifts fruit, shade and shelter, are venerated.

But human activities are now impacting this world of plants. Each plant has its own environmental range or the temperature, humidity and soil within which it flourishes. Climate change is impacting plants across an elevation gradient and latitude and longitude. Once, apple trees were grown in the lower reaches of the Himalayas. Now, with climate change making the higher parts warmer, people can grow apples there -- which also reflects how many traditional crops can no longer be grown in these areas.

PURPLE REIGN: The bougainvillea with its papery flowers is a familiar sight across India, an evergreen climber which thrives in hot and dry climates and protects itself against predators with its thick thorns. Picture: iStock

Many forests are also growing drier with more frequent forest fires breaking out. This gives invasive plant species like thorny lantana the opportunity to take over, further drying the forest and crowding out productive plants. That means animals can't get food in forests -- they have to come out, seeking food in human habitations. Around Bannerghata National Park, many farmers have started growing non-food crops like eucalyptus as animals seek food crops to eat. But such crops are water-hungry and demand chemicals, adding to pollution, while leaving animals starved.

We must be far more aware of our impacts on plants. Existentially, we lose ourselves when we lose plants -- philosophically too, imagine a world bereft of plants, trees and flowers. What is left to gladden our hearts in such a world? We need to observe the plant world around us with more care. While hundreds of thousands of trees are chopped down every year, plants face human impacts every day, from encroachment to concretisation. We need to protect them from these dangers. Also, wherever you are, do plant something -- put potted plants on your balcony. Convince your office to grow a green roof. Plant seeds in an open patch. I have seen slum inhabitants in Bengaluru who live in tin shacks but plant saplings in old paint buckets. If such marginalised people can look after plants, the endowed who have more space certainly can.

Perhaps the banyan is the most special plant to me. The banyan tree I mentioned makes me feel like I'm in the presence of a very wise being, someone who has seen worlds change and history play out. If this tree, which grew from a little plant to this mighty being, is standing here, sheltering so many birds, animals and human beings, there is still hope for the world.",2022-02-05T01:06:00Z

On January 1, the division bench of Chief Justice Ravi Ranjan and Justice Sujit Narayan directed the secretary of the department of forests, environment and climate change and PCCF-WL to appear before the court on February 4 and submit a vision document for PTR and a full map of the villages around the forest. The court also directed the officials to apprise the court of the steps being taken to reclaim the fauna in the reserve.

The Times of India,"bill:   Congress wants Biological Diversity Bill to be referred to Standing Committee, experts oppose proposed changes in Act | India News - Times of India",,"NEW DELHI: A day after the Biological Diversity (Amendment) Bill, 2021 was introduced in Lok Sabha, the Opposition Congress on Friday opposed the government's proposal to refer it to a select committee instead of opting for ministry-specific standing committee to examine its provisions.

The Bill, introduced by environment minister Bhupender Yadav on Thursday, seeks to encourage Indian system of medicine, bring more foreign investments in the chain of biological resources and decriminalize certain provisions for use of traditional knowledge of such resources by local communities, 'vaids', 'hakims' and registered AYUSH practitioners who have been practicing indigenous medicines for ""sustenance and livelihood"".

Flagging his party's opposition which wants the Bill to be referred to standing committee, Congress member in Rajya Sabha and chairman of Parliamentary standing committee on science & technology and environment, Jairam Ramesh, on Friday wrote to the Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla, urging him not to allow the government to take the select committee route.

""The subject matter of the Bill and indeed of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 which is sought to be amended belongs fairly and squarely to the ministry of environment, forests and climate change, and consequently to the standing committee related to it,"" said Ramesh in his letter to the Speaker.

The Opposition suspects that the select committee, headed by any ruling party member, may not do justice with the various concerns raised by different experts over certain provisions of the Bill which has not only diluted the penalty provision by replacing imprisonment with fines in the proposed legislation but also replaced judge (court) with a joint secretary-level officer to determine the penalties.

Ramesh has in his letter, however, not stated any specific reason. ""I don't wish to say more on the motivations of the government to bypass the standing committee concerned and refer the contentious Bill to a select committee. The motivations are obvious. All I wish to say is that the move is a deliberate insult to the standing committee,"" Ramesh wrote, urging the Speaker to refer the Bill to the concerned standing committee.

Experts, meanwhile, questioned why the government didn't seek public comments on the proposed amendment as it concerns every part of the country and also pertains to India's international commitment under Convention on Biological Diversity.

The Legal Initiative for Forest and Environment (LIFE), New Delhi-based environmental research group, in its analysis said that the principal aims of the proposed legislation was to ""reduce the compliance burden"" and ""facilitate investment"". ""Conservation of biological resources is clearly the last priority. The Amendment Bill will undo all the efforts made in the last few years to implement the Biological Diversity Act,"" it said.

Noting that the main focus of the Bill is to facilitate the trade in biodiversity, the LIFE said, ""Not a single provision in the proposed amendment relates to protection, conservation or increasing the stake of local communities in the sustainable use and conservation of biodiversity. The amendment seems to be done with the sole intention of providing benefit to the AYUSH industry. There is not even one provision in the proposed amendment which aims to enhance either the level of protection of biodiversity or in making the Nagoya Protocol implemented in its true letter and spirit.""",2021-12-18T04:28:00Z
The Times of India,NGT gives nod for Delhi-Doon e-way; 11k trees to be cut | India News - Times of India,,"DEHRADUN: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Monday gave a go-ahead to the construction of the Delhi-Dehradun expressway, which is expected to reduce travel time between the two cities to under three hours from the 5-6 hours it takes currently. With the tribunal's nod to the project, around 11,000 trees are set to be axed on a 19-km-long stretch of the expressway from Ganeshpur to Asharodi (NH-72A).

""We find it difficult to hold that there is no application of mind by the ministry of environment, forest, and climate change (MoEF&CC) in granting forest cell clearance,"" said the order passed by a bench headed by NGT chairperson, Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel.

The petitioners, Doon-based NGO 'Citizens for Green Doon' had approached the Supreme Court earlier this year to avoid the tree felling. The apex court had referred the matter to NGT. The petitioners contended that being almost 210-km-long, the project should have undergone a mandatory environmental impact assessment (EIA), which it didn't. However, the tribunal ruled that it ""wasn't required."" ""Overall road connectivity cannot be taken to be one project for the purpose,"" the bench stated.

The tribunal said that the Delhi-Dehradun highway is an important highway that connects Delhi, Haryana and Western UP to Dehradun and higher reaches of Himalayas and hence, ""the capacity augmentation of this highway is not only important for connecting the state capital of Uttarakhand with national capital, but is also vital for strategic defence purposes for timely and seamless movement of Army/ warheads to higher reaches of Himalayas.""

The order stressed on the need to ensure that mitigation measures are effectively implemented and monitored on-ground by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). The NGT set up a 12-member committee comprising government officials from organisations such as the Central Pollution Control Board, Wildlife Institute of India, and the Forest Research Institute to be headed by the chief secretary of Uttarakhand.",2021-12-13T22:55:00Z

Earlier, schools in these four districts stayed closed from November 15-22 after a similar order from the state government.

The Friday order, issued by S Narayana, pollution secretary, Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), also sought a ban on construction activities and the use of diesel generator (DG) sets in all 14 NCR districts.

""After considering the present situation, we decided to shut down schools in the four districts. There is also a ban on diesel generator sets in 14 NCR districts. So, the power department is under directions to ensure uninterrupted electric supply to these districts and avoid the use of DG sets by any consumer, even in case of emergencies,"" said S Narayana, also, secretary, environment and climate change department, Haryana.

On Friday, the Haryana government instituted a specialised task force to enforce, monitor and report compliance with the revised pollution norms. ""The task force will strictly implement the directions issued by the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) in NCR and adjoining areas. It will also report compliance status to the commission on a fortnightly basis, i.e. on 1st and 16th of each month,"" said S Narayana.

HSPCB has also asked authorities to prevent waste burning and manual sweeping in the open. NCR industries, not running on PNG or clean fuel, are under directions to operate only up to eight hours a day from Monday to Friday. These industries will remain closed on Saturdays and Sundays.

On Thursday, the Supreme Court, taking cognisance of the poor air quality in the region, had directed the Centre and the governments of Punjab, Haryana and Delhi to take urgent steps to reduce the air quality index. Following the SC direction, the CAQM convened a meeting, and the government decided to shut down schools in four districts.

Schools have not been functioning with 100% capacity since the pandemic lockdown. The state government had planned to reopen schools with 100% capacity from December 1 but later withdrew that decision over the pollution levels.

Recently, it decided to continue running schools with only 50% capacity given the threat from Omicron, the newly-discovered coronavirus variant. But now, schools are closed again due to pollution.

Online classes started during the pandemic seem likely to be continued for now. Meanwhile, parents expressed concerns over the government ""frequently changing its mind"".

The Times of India,Four ticklish questions on India's climate pathway - Times of India,,"India's stand on coal is pragmatic. Growth and net zero are incompatible for some time.India made the headlines at the end of the climate summit in Glasgow for its insistence on watering down a global commitment to phase out coal. Instead, it ought to have been praised for some ambitious pledges for a still-emerging economy; a 50-year deadline to achieve net-zero emissions and some bold 10-year targets, including 500 GW of renewable energy capacity and 50% of energy needs from renewables by 2030. Even these will present tough choices to policymakers.

Should climate change or growth come first?

For climate crusaders there is no issue more important than temperature rise; it's existential. But for hundreds of millions of people in India who live in relative poverty, there are more immediate existential issues: healthcare, sanitation on the one hand and productive jobs on the other. Only sustained double-digit economic growth can make India prosperous. Therefore, should growth remain the overarching goal of policy or should net zero and its subset of goals take precedence? Unfortunately, there are likely to be contradictions between the two for the foreseeable future, especially as India occupies the manufacturing space being vacated by China. Competitiveness of the economy requires reliable, plentiful and cheap energy. For reasons of technological feasibility, renewable sources may not be able to meet all those requirements in the next decade.",2021-11-16T02:32:00Z

The Times of India,Recharging groundwater only way to slake Tamil Nadu's thirst | Chennai News - Times of India,,"CHENNAI: Monsoon is here. Rain has led to flooding and yet Tamil Nadu is almost always short of water. More so because of the absence of a groundwater policy.

The ground and surface water resources wing of the public works department, in a study conducted last year, an order for which was passed last week, found groundwater is overexploited (with more than 100% extraction) in 435 revenue firkas (sub-divisions within taluks) in the state.

At least 26 firkas in Chennai district are over-exploited, including all those in Egmore-Nungambakkam, Fort-Tondiarpet, Mambalam-Guindy, Mylapore-Triplicane, Purasawalkam-Perambur, Ambattur, Maduravoyal and Tiruvottiyur regions. Only Alandur, Sholinganallur, and Pallikaranai are safe.

Thanjavur, the core delta region, and Salem top the districts that are over-exploited. The only solace is that the number of over-exploited and critical firkas have reduced from 462 and 79 respectively in 2017. The study shows 99 firkas have improved since the last assessment. Sustained efforts such as strengthening bunds and recharge wells, restoration of water bodies and check dams by government agencies in recent years may have helped, but the state's condition is precarious.

Water experts say TN is the third worst state in terms of groundwater exploitation after Punjab and Haryana. ""First the state has to harvest rainwater and use it judiciously. Most of our basins are 'closed', meaning demand cannot be met anymore. Demand keeps growing with increased population and urbanisation, while the amount of rainfall remains the same. Climate change has led to intense rainfall in a shorter period,"" said B V Mudgal, Anna University Centre for Water Resources director, calling for measures to store as much rainwater as possible.

In terms of groundwater table, Tirupur, Namakkal, Tuticorin and Dharmapuri districts have recorded a sharp decline.

Owing to poor availability of ground water, providing household tap water connection in rural areas is a pipedream. Municipal administration and water supply minister K N Nehru and minister for rural development K R Periakaruppan met Union Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat recently, seeking funds for drinking water projects. Rapid urbanisation has been taking a toll on the state, which is heavily dependent on its neighbours states to meet its irrigation and drinking water needs.

""People want to dispose of the runoff as quickly as possible. The government has sought to address this by encouraging rooftop rainwater harvesting. But we need to go beyond that and look at Sustainable Urban Drainage System (SUDS). SUDS has a focused approach to intercept rainfall and runoff at multiple levels. It gives sufficient opportunity and time for possible infiltration and recharge.

""Recharge shafts embedded within storm water drains is a welcome idea in the newly laid out integrated storm water drains in Chennai. However, the scale of adaptation of SUDS in storm water drains has to start from the planning stage for improvement in groundwater level, quality and to reduce floods. Building regulations should be enforced to ensure there is undeveloped areas in every project to facilitate infiltration of water into the ground,"" Balaji Narasimhan professor at IIT Madras Environmental and Water Resources Engineering. Narasimhan was associated with the development of water resources information system in the Union Jal Shakti ministry.

At present, Chennai Metropolitan Area Ground Water (Regulation) Act regulates groundwater extraction in Chennai and 304 villages in Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur. ""The government is working on a draft groundwater bill, which will soon be introduced in the assembly. There is no mechanism to check extraction for irrigation, which accounts for 70% of the total extraction. There is a plan to put a cap on the power of motors used for irrigation or restrict the hours of extraction,"" said a senior government official.

The new law is likely to form a water regulatory authority with statutory powers, headed by the chief secretary and comprising representatives of government agencies like TWAD Board and Metrowater. It will impose penalties for violations and lay down restrictions on the use of groundwater.",2021-11-03T04:13:00Z
Hindustan Times,Scrap to sustainability: A Bengaluru startup's attempt to set up environment-friendly offices,,"Bangalore Creative Circus (BCC) is now arguably one of the biggest spaces in the city and has become a platform that continues to attract a growing community of artists, scientists, chefs, gardeners, dreamers and changemakers.

The 'Before the Flood' documentary starring actor Leonardo DiCaprio set Ajay Raghavan, an employment lawyer in Bengaluru, on a path to create a sustainable and environment-friendly office space in April 2017.

The documentary prompted Raghavan, 43, to learn more about one of the most overused but rarely applied words, ""sustainable"", over the next two years, meeting and discovering more on the space. ""We didn't know exactly what, but knew we wanted to be a platform to do stuff around sustainability,"" Ajay said.

He met several people that year with the same passion for sustainability and climate change, but a platform was missing to build a community for ""impact""- a word that has now become a guiding force for the group. It was in 2019, Ajay decided to start a platform by renting out a 20,000 sq ft defunct factory in Yeshwanthpur. That platform was launched last week. Delays were mostly caused by the Covid-19 outbreak and the pandemic-induced lockdowns.

Bangalore Creative Circus (BCC) is now arguably one of the biggest spaces in the city and has become a platform that continues to attract a growing community of artists, scientists, chefs, gardeners, dreamers and changemakers.

The BCC emphasises its goal to address universal challenges ""by inspiring a regenerative culture of living in our home, the city of Bengaluru.""

Bengaluru is among the fastest-growing cities in the world with a population of over 12 million as it continues to attract investments, opportunities in an increasingly globalised village. But the pace of its growth has made it a victim of its success as the city continues to lose its green cover. Rapidly commercialising spaces have encroached upon lakes, deteriorating the quality of air and water, pollution and denigrating the very lives it hopes to improve.

Everything inside BCC is made with reused products. Scrap from Raghavan's old office make the walls of the cafe, old and unused electronic appliances are now art, Tyres line the walls and beer cans have plants growing out of them. The food served in the cafe is grown in a small space in the back. The office out of the stones they found on the site and a large seahorse that hangs from the ceiling, from air conditioner ducts.

Since the project began in 2019, people from all backgrounds have come forward to help the cause and build BCC into sustainable working space. Manisha Vinod, deeply inspired by environmentalist David Attenborough's words, decided it was time to move away from her corporate job and contribute towards restoring the planet's biodiversity.

""When do policies come into play? When they are pressurised by the public at some level. Policies come into being when the affluent, the people in power, entrepreneurs, senior management, when they identify risk and feel the need for a change in policies is when real change will happen at scale. So, platforms like this will at least play a role in them to rethink their business,"" she said.

BCC now has Ajay (Manisha's husband), serial clean-tech startup investor, Alok Agarwal, Siddharth Lakshman, the in-house permaculture expert, Nayantara Bagla, the chef and Lakshman, performing key roles to operate the space.

Lakshman said that as a global community, as well as in our own country, we are faced with a crisis of deteriorating health, socio-economic justice, and ecological problems. At the planetary level, human activities are leading to alarming levels of climate change, extreme weather, deforestation, rising sea levels, biodiversity loss among others that are threatening our very existence on this planet.

""At the level of the human system, we are faced with a growing economic disparity, growing poverty, food insecurity, water scarcity, refugee crisis, agrarian crisis, pandemics, congestion, etc. At the individual level, humans are experiencing unprecedented rates of mental health issues, addictions, degenerate diet and lifestyle issues, etc,"" he said.

BCC will monetise its goals by letting out the space for events, holding workshops and from its 'farm-to-table cafe.

""The standard line today is that he (Keynes) didn't figure in the massive increase in consumerism,"" Graeber writes.

This increase in consumerism has deflected attention away from more pressing needs.

Hindustan Times,"Uttarakhand's Corbett tiger reserve likely to be renamed as Ramganga National Park, says park director",,"The name of Corbett Tiger Reserve (CTR) in Uttarakhand is likely to be renamed as Ramganga National Park, reserve director Rahul said on Wednesday.

The Ramaganga river flows through the tiger reserve and is the lifeline of the reserve. In 1954-55, the reserve was briefly named as Ramganga National Park.

The decision to restore the name of the reserve was taken by Union minister of state for environment, forest and climate change (MOEFCC) Ashwini Kumar Choubey during his visit on October 3, the director said.

""The minister, during his visit to the reserve, said that Ramganga National Park is a good name instead of Jim Corbett National Park... so he asked us to initiate the process to do the same. If the forest ministry instructs us to prepare a proposal of this sort, we will act accordingly,"" the director said.

""Earlier, the reserve's name was Ramganga National Park... it was renamed as Corbett Tiger Reserve in 1955-56,"" he added.

Another official at the forest reserve also claimed that the minister had asked the director to begin work for renaming the park and mentioned the same in the visitor's book kept in the museum in Dhangarhi.

A senior official from the environment ministry, however, said that Choubey had made a mere suggestion and the idea was not a formal plan.

""This is not a formal plan. It's only something the minister had written as a visitor in the register,"" the official who did not wish to be named said.

Choubey visited the national park on Sunday to conclude the tiger safari organised as part of 'Azadi ka Amrit Mahotsav' and Wildlife Week celebrations.

The Corbett reserve was established in 1936 as Hailey National Park after Malcolm Hailey, former governor of the then Uttar Pradesh province. After Independence, it was renamed as Ramganga National Park in 1954-55. In the following year, it was renamed as Corbett Tiger Reserve after hunter and writer Edward Jim Corbett.

The reserve is spread over 520 km and rich in flora and fauna; it is known for tigers, leopards, elephants, deer, bear and several species of other wild animals, reptiles and birds. Around three lakh tourists visit the reserve and the park earns around ₹10 crore from tourism every year, Rahul said.

AG Ansari, a Kumaon-based wildlife activist, said, ""It will be injustice with Jim Corbett if the CTR is renamed.

The Times of India," Chhattisgarh: Use soft words to address elephants & human-animal conflict, ministry directs PCCFs | India News - Times of India",,"Raipur: Don't use harsh terms like 'Aatanki' (terrorist), 'Utpati' (oppressor), 'Gussel' (angered) for elephants to narrate an attack by them, as it sends out a message that the pachyderms were 'deadly foes' and the next generations would treat it accordingly, said Ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF&CC)in a letter issued to all principal chief conservators of forest and wildlife of 17 states carrying out 'project elephant', including Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh.

The letter from Dr K Muthamizh Selvan, scientist 'D' (project elephant) from the Ministry insisted that the use of harsh Hindi words are often used by electronic media and chief wildlife wardens in affected states should ensure not to use such words.

The move comes after a wildlife enthusiast from Chhattisgarh Nitin Singhvi raised the issue and the letter from Ministry mentions his concern.

Singhvi had written a letter in August highlighting the matter before senior officials of MoEF&CC.

Speaking to TOI, Singhvi said that it is very important for media and officers to understand that the words used to describe an attack, aggression, or anger of an elephant, create a negative perception in the minds of people against the animal that is otherwise loved.

""An Elephant is the only animal on the earth that is addressed with the words like an august animal, dignified, majestic, regal demeanor, paramount, gentle species, etc. Even Homo sapiens are not addressed with such respected words. In Chhattisgarh, these lovely giants are addressed as 'hatyara', 'hinsak', 'pagal' and sentences like 'stubborn elephant shooed away', 'tusker nuisance continues', 'giants become headache and enemy for villagers. The use of these words give an adverse message to the public in general, and there is the possibility that the Gen Z (below 12 years of those born between19971 and 2012) and Zen A (born after 2012), after growing up, will treat the elephants like deadly foes: just like we treat and kill snakes even when 98 per cent of them are non-poisonous. We do this because we have been taught since our childhood that snakes are very dangerous,"" Singhvi wrote in his letter.

He insisted that it was necessary to send out a message that we can co-exist with elephants else it will increase the human-elephant conflict.

Ministry has thus urged the officers to insist upon using sober words that do not create panic via news or information.",2021-09-28T18:08:00Z
The Times of India,Green and blue... two colours that will shape Delhi's future | Delhi News - Times of India,,"NEW DELHI: The green and blue infrastructure -- Delhi's green belts and waterbodies -- will play a key role in shaping its future, the draft Master Plan for Delhi 2041 envisages, focusing not only on their protection but also on increasing their net area.

The draft plan states these assets will help in mitigating climate change and play a key role in reducing air, noise, water and soil pollution. A database will be maintained by the government and Delhi Development Authorty to periodically assess their ""health"".

To bring people closer to these natural assets, MPD 41 aims to provide public access to a few by developing them as recreational sites consisting of ""interactive"" zones where temporary activities such as yoga, nature classes, environmental research, picnics, camping and biodiversity tours will be permitted. Buildings will face these green-blue assets and maintain active faces in the form of balconies, windows and pedestrian entries.

Cycleways and walkways in and around these sites have also been encouraged. For the Yamuna, a 300-metre-wide green buffer will be required along the edge, with a 30-metre area left for grasses and ground cover, while development of 75-100-metre-wide greenways with cycling and walking trails have been suggested. However, no permanent structure will be allowed in the floodplain.

""The health of all environmental assets shall be monitored from time to time,"" the draft plan states.

Growth in Delhi's green cover will be carried out by using only native plants and species, which will act as pollution filters, while techniques such as Miyawaki forests and smog absorption towers can be adopted at hotspots. A ""tree directory"" will also be maintained, with each agency identifying unique tree corridors or heritage trees in its area.

Pavements, roads and roofs will be constructed or coated with light-coloured materials, with a high albedo value wherever possible. ""This can reduce local temperature by 3-5 degrees Celsius. Road sections shall include appropriate trees and buffers to reduce air and noise pollution, as well as sustainable urban drainage components.""

To further reduce air pollution, MPD 41 prescribes adoption of mix-use and transit-oriented development to reduce average trip lengths and bring jobs and homes closer to transit networks.

Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director of research and advocacy at Centre for Science and Environment, says for the first time, new principles of urban planning have been adopted explicitly to control vehicular pollution, which is a good sign. ""However, there is still scope and need for further tightening of the action targets for all pollution sources and overall air quality,"" she said.",2021-06-10T01:37:00Z
Hindustan Times,5 Maharashtra cities to join global 'Race to Zero' campaign ahead of Conference of the Parties26,,"Five Maharashtra cities - Mumbai, Pune, Aurangabad, Nagpur and Nashik - are set to join the 'Race to Zero' global campaign, founded last year in December under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, state environment minister Aaditya Thackeray said in a recently held a virtual meeting with Climate Voices (a consortium of three independent environment groups operating in the state).

The announcement comes days before a global virtual summit on April 22 and 23 - set to be led by US President Joe Biden - where 40 countries will discuss efforts taken at a state-level to restrict global warming to a limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius (in light of the Paris Agreements). Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also slated to attend the event as an invitee.

Thackeray also said that the decision was taken in the run-up to United Nations Climate Change Conference - Conference of the Parties (COP26) to be held in November 2021 at Glasgow, United Kingdom.

""Cities joining 'Race to Zero' will seek to prevent future climate threats, create jobs, and unlock equitable, sustainable growth. These cities must publicly acknowledge and recognise the global climate emergency, keeping climate resilience in line with urban decision making, pledging to reach net zero (carbon emissions) in the 2040s or sooner,"" Climate Voices said in a statement on Friday.

To bring Maharashtra's climate action strategy in line with global standards, Thackeray revealed to Climate Voices that his government has also entered into a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the C40 Climate Leadership Group - another global campaign in which 97 megacities collaboratively promote sustainable action on climate change. As per the terms of MoU, a draft climate action plan specifically for Mumbai is set to be prepared by August, the first for a C40 city in the Indian subcontinent.

In his discussion with Climate Voices, Thackeray reportedly also discussed developments in Maharashtra's transition to clean energy. The state will soon float a non-conventional energy policy, involving an investment of ₹1 lakh crore (by 2025) for strengthening solar, wind, hydroelectricity and waste-to-energy infrastructure. Through these methods, the state aims to generate 17,385-megawatts power.

""We are encouraging the use of alternative clean fuels like hydrogen cell fuel while our commitment is to have a minimum of 25% of our overall energy needs to be met through solar energy by 2025. Innovative methods like solarising highways, barren farmlands and floating solar panels on our dams are a part of that effort,"" said Thackeray.

Maharashtra will also soon implement its Electric Vehicles (EV) Policy, approved in early 2018, which aims to catalyse an increase in the usage of EVs to 500,000 during its five-year policy duration, and also to create over 100,000 jobs, largely through a ₹25.5 crore investment in the manufacturing sector.

In the past 50 years, drought events in Maharashtra increased seven-fold, alongside a six-fold increase in extreme floods. It is also a state that remains at high-climate risk, due to droughts and heatwaves, which impact both agriculture and industries. In the past calendar year alone, Maharashtra disbursed almost ₹13,000 crore to compensate for losses incurred due to climate change-related weather events.

What does net zero mean?

Net zero, or carbon neutrality, is an emissions target which involves the complete reduction of anthropogenic greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. To achieve this, experts say it is necessary to not only reduce carbon emissions, but also to find ways to actively reduce the load of greenhouse gases already emitted. Development of solar and nuclear energy, electric and hydrogen-based fuels, halting deforestation and actively restoring denuded forests are touchstones of the global race among countries to 'net zero', as part of the Paris Agreements",2021-04-16T18:51:00Z
The Times of India,"State to add 17,385MW renewable power by 2025 | Nagpur News - Times of India",,"Nagpur: The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has come out with a renewable energy policy that has set a target of adding 17,385MW renewable energy capacity by 2025. It was cleared by the cabinet on Wednesday. An investment of Rs 75,000 crore is expected in this sector in the coming five years.

Other than this, a lot of solar energy will be generated in off-grid mode especially by installing 1 lakh solar farm pumps every year. The current installed capacity is 9,305MW and work on projects having 2,123MW capacity is in progress.

The state policy is in line with India's commitment to international community to reduce its carbon emissions. The country has signed the Paris Agreement in 2015 wherein 40% of its power generation capacity will be from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030.

The policy also aims to meet Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission's (MERC) targets for renewable energy, which MSEDCL has consistently failed to meet.

The mammoth share of the total target belongs to solar -- 12,930MW. Other sources include: wind -- 2,500MW, bagasse and agricultural waste -- 1,350MW, small hydroelectric -- 380MW, municipal solid waste -- 200MW and new technologies -- 25MW.

The policy envisages a government expenditure of Rs4,250 crore for achieving this target. The state will not spend any money on bagasse, hydroelectric and wind energy projects. The entire investment will be done by private players.

Increase in solar capacity through various routes has been stated in the policy. 10,000MW solar capacity will be added by setting up plants with minimum 1MW capacity. Private players will be selected through competitive bidding.

A major boost for solar rooftop has been envisaged under this policy. The state aims to add another 2,000MW in coming five years. Another 500MW capacity will be added by converting water supply schemes in urban as well as rural areas to solar.

Supplying solar power to micro water supply schemes will add another 30MW. Solar electric vehicle charging stations having 50MW capacity will be started. Hybrid solar-wind projects having 50MW capacity will be set up on land belonging to Maharashtra Energy Development Agency (MEDA).

Under the off-grid projects, 12MW capacity will be installed atop government buildings and 40MW atop cooperative society buildings. One lakh solar farm pumps will be provided to agriculturists every year. Further, 10,000 houses would be provided solar power per annum.

Renewable energy expert Ajit Prasad Ganguly said that the targets were ambitious but achievable. ""For example if the government really decides it can distribute 1 lakhs farm pumps a year. However, more clarity is needed in the policy,"" he added.

The Times of India,Delhi airport becomes Asia Pacific's first carbon accredited airport,,"Delhi's Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport has become Asia Pacific's first Level 4+ (Transition) accredited airport under ACI's Airport Carbon Accreditation program. This has been informed by the GMR Group, which operates and owns the airport.

The announcement was made by Airport Council International (ACI) recently during its Europe annual assembly and Congress, which stated that the airport is a pioneer in sustainability in their region and is now setting its climate goals in alignment with the ambition of the Paris Agreement. As such, the Delhi International Airport has achieved a major goal by becoming the first airport in Asia Pacific region to get Level 4+ accreditation for 'sustainability' under ACI's Airport Carbon Accreditation (ACA) program.

The ACA, launched in 2009, adheres the global standard for carbon management in the airport industry, which aims to enable and encourage airports and its stakeholders to device best practices in Greenhouse Gas (GHG) management to achieve emission reductions.

Reportedly, the Delhi airport achieved 'Level 3+, Neutrality' in 2016, i.e., the first Carbon Neutral Airport in the Asia Pacific region, a spokesperson from Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) stated.

Referring to the latest achievement, Director General of ACI Asia Pacific Stefano Baronci stated that Delhi's IGI Airport is raising the bar in Asia-Pacific by becoming one of the world's first airports to obtain the new important Airport Carbon Accreditation Level 4+ Transition accreditation.

As per the reports, the ACI this year revised the programme's levels and added two new levels -- Level 4 (Transformation) and Level 4+ (Transition). These levels have been introduced to ensure that the objectives of the said programme are in line with the Paris Agreement, and to aim that the global average temperature does not exceed 1.5°C.

The Times of India,Not moving away from coal is killing 1 lakh a year in India | India News - Times of India,,"India is increasingly powering itself on coal. About three-fourth of India's electricity is coal-based, its dependence on coal is growing faster than any other country in the world (6% a year) and coal extraction has doubled to 500 million tons since 1994. It's killing people.

""The coal complex in India has significant health impacts -- mainly through local air pollution -- including premature mortality, ranging from 80,000 to 115,000 premature deaths per year,"" says the study, published in 'Ecological Economics' by Elsevier this month. Workers and people living around coal mines contract diseases by inhaling coal dust and drinking polluted water. Besides, mining accidents have also been taking thousands of lives: ""From 2001 to 2014, more than 7,000 accidents were reported across all coal mining companies in India. In the three years between 2015 and 2017, more than 200 coal miners lost their lives in such accidents.""

This is linked, the authors point out, to the fact that despite an increase in renewable sources of energy, India continues to depend on coal. ""Both hydroelectricity and nuclear are being promoted as sources of energy production in India, and both result in socio-ecological justice movements. What we argue in the article is that there is no transition but rather addition of the different energy sources, and coal continues to dominate the energy mix, despite the rhetoric of renewables and the climate crisis,"" lead author Brototi Roy, from the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, told TOI.

So, while coal contributed to 23% of India's energy supply in 1970, its share is nearly 40% now. If all fossil fuels are taken into account, India is sourcing 70% of its energy from non-renewable sources. In fact, India accounts for 10% of the global energy supply from coal.

But it's not that renewable resources are not being invested in. Data from the International Energy Agency show India's hydro, wind and solar power generation has gone up 60% since 1990. But the share of these energy sources has dropped from 14% then to 10% now.

The logic, so far, has been that ""continued extraction of coal and expansion of the electricity system are necessary in order to meet the 'needs' of the population, especially those of India's poor, making coal 'a compulsion' rather than 'an option',"" the paper says. But, the paper adds, the primary consumer of Indian electricity is industry (40%) and not households (25%).

The other justification has been development: ""The most visible justification ... is that coal supposedly allows for development, that is, for industrialization following the Western (and more recently Chinese) blueprint ... with mines and power plants and trickle-down effects into the economy generating the employment the country desperately needs; in sum, with coal improving the income and the lives of all Indians. This was, for example, the justification provided for the auction of 41 coal blocks for private companies to mine in June 2020.""

But, again, the paper adds, ""Less than 1% of employment is in mining and electricity, gas, and water supply combined ... As coal output increases, average employment in coal mining either stagnates or even declines. This can be observed for the Indian average as well as for the three main coal-mining states (Chhattisgarh, Orissa, and Jharkhand).""",2020-10-28T06:00:00Z
The Times of India,IIT Guwahati introduces the first-of-its-kind course on UN-Sustainable Development Goals 2030 - Times of India,Kangkan Kalita,"GUWAHATI: Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati (IITG) has become the first IIT to introduce a course on UN-Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030 in the Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) curriculum from this academic year (2020-2021).

In 2015, world leaders agreed at the United Nations General Assembly to implement 17Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that are meant to transform the world, building upon the principle of ""leaving no one behind"". These 17 goals aim to create a better world by 2030, by ending poverty, fighting inequality, addressing the urgency of climate change and several other holistic approaches.

The course provides a unique opportunity to the B.Tech students to understand the concepts of sustainability and work towards building a better society for everyone, said an IITG release.

""The course will be offered to the second year B.Tech students as a compulsory course, to reorient the thinking of young and dynamic individuals towards the path of sustainable development,"" it further added.

Due to the interdisciplinary nature of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, Department of Humanities and Social Sciences - the nodal department for this course- has collaborated and pooled resources from eight other departments of the Institute viz. Departments of Biosciences and Bioengineering, Civil Engineering, Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, Electronics and Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Design and Physics - to design and implement the course. Faculty members from each of these departments will jointly conduct the course and will provide exposure to B.Tech students on the technological, economical, ecological and societal aspects of these 17 SDGs.

""With only 10 more years remaining to fulfil these objectives, it becomes very vital that the students are taught about the goals of inclusive and sustainable growth and through this course, offered by faculty members from across engineering, science and humanities departments, IIT Guwahati wishes to prepare the students to play leading roles in 'Transforming the World,"" IITG director Prof. TG Sitharam said.

Prof. Anamika Barua, the course coordinator from the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT Guwahati, said that this would be the first time the nine departments of IIT Guwahati have joined together to offer a course at the undergraduate level, realising that sustainability challenges and inclusive growth go hand-in-hand and has to be understood at the crossroads of science and society through an interdisciplinary lens. She further added, ""The students, through this course, would be educated to critically evaluate the idea of Sustainability as an emerging discipline and have an opinion on the role for India, as a nation, in the successful implementation of the new SDGs"".

Faculty members from all the nine disciplines will contribute in demonstrating the importance of adopting an interdisciplinary approach of sustainability. Several case studies will be used to demonstrate the ways of realising the SDGs and the strategies needed to move towards a sustainable pattern of development. The case studies will include topics from multiple disciplines such as growth, inclusive society, sustainable cities, transport, designs, technology, digital revolution and sustainable production & consumption. The course will also highlight the ways of financing the SDGs, the new financing mechanisms and global fund as well implementing SDGs through governance and policy tools.

It is envisioned that the new course will enable students to articulate the role of research for promoting Sustainable Development and meet the 169 targets as part of the 17 SDGs and how the sustainable development perspective relates to their own work and career goals.

The course on SDGs will enable students to realise the importance of a stable relationship between human activities and the natural world for a healthy, clean and safe environment, and, thus, make them responsible individuals and the world a better place for inclusive growth and overall prosperity.

Speaking about the intension behind the course, Prof. Vimal Katiyar, involved in designing the course and from the Department of Chemical Engineering, IIT Guwahati, said, ""With this course, IIT Guwahati intends to nurture budding technocrats through sustainable technological practices to achieve an environmentally benign, safe and inclusive industrial ecosystem and foster innovations for the development of a sustainable society. This course would further embark upon a student's perception towards choosing ecologically accountable employment.""",2020-07-06T09:31:00Z
The Hindu,This home-schooled teen has been selected for Fellowship for Climate Action,,"Hemang Vellore loves his geek status. The home-schooled teen is now a part of Fellowship for Climate Action

Hemang Vellore is 14 years-old and feels flattered when anyone calls him a geek and he specifies he's an 'environment geek'. At least three days in a week he's on Google Hangouts, and admits he loves solving math problems. ""Only when I get time and feel like doing so,"" he clarifies categorically.

Hemang is unschooled; he gave up attending school owing to bullying by classmates who couldn't understand his interests. ""I wasn't happy learning the same things from the textbooks. I questioned a lot and ended up being bullied,"" he says. Now his mother homeschools him. Hemang says, ""That makes two of us. Me and my mother learn together and it is absolute fun."" Hemang's sources of knowledge also include various online platforms, interviews with experts, and talks by speakers on various fields. He has since opted for Anant's Fellowship for Climate Action.

Ahmedabad-based Anant National University launched a first-of-its-kind fellowship called Anant Fellowship for Climate Action, which shifts the focus from the unprecedented level of climate anxiety we see around us today to offering people ways to be part of the solution to mitigate climate change. The long-term mission of the Fellowship is to create a community -- offline and online -- of climate change trailblazers who work together and cross-pollinate each other's work with ideas and expertise across sectors, regions, and generations.

His learnings from several online platforms have made Hemang a part of programmes like impacting Global Goals, Climate Emergency, Fridays For Future, Youth 4 Climate Strike Activist . He has also been a TEDx speaker. He is pursuing a Diploma in Digital Fabrication from Fab Academy, Center of Bits and Atoms, MIT Boston at FABLAB 0.

Hemang's interest isn't just limited to climate and environment. He is also a big fan of Robotics and that made him the National Champion in Robo Golf 2016, conducted by MIT, Lawrence Tech University, Michigan and NovaRobo in IIT Hyderabad in 2016. He has won several awards in Robotic events at NIT Warangal, JNTU Jagtial, Geek Angels Summit, Start Up Carnival, and tech fests at IIIT Hyderabad, Osmania University and various IITs across the country, , to name a few. He is trained in Arduino and Raspberry Pie IOT concepts. Hemang and his team conduct Robokshetra, series of workshops on Robotics and related activities, for those who are interested

To him, climate change and its impact on earth has been a very special subject. ""We see the world changing around us everyday as an impact of climate change. I want to know how to minimise it and make use of the resources available for our best use,"" he adds.

Is he worried about the excessive screen time his activities take? ""Not really. That's my window of knowledge. When I am bored of accumulating knowledge I play Call of Duty,"" he laughs.",2020-06-17T06:14:00Z
The Times of India,Gaganyaan gets only 30% of money Isro asked this year | India News - Times of India,,"BENGALURU: India's ambitious Gaganyaan project -- the country's first human spaceflight programme -- has received only 30% of the funds Isro had sought in this year's budget, but the space agency maintains it can work its way around.

Isro had projected an amount of Rs 4,257 crore in its budget estimated for 2020-21, against which, only Rs 1,200 crore has been allocated.

The department-related Parliamentary Committee on Science & Technology, Environment, Forests and Climate Change, in its report tabled on Friday has noted: ""The Gaganyaan programme is a very prestigious national endeavour with global significance. But the budgetary allocation for 2020-21 does not reflect this importance.""

It has further recommended that the allocation under the Gaganyaan programme be enhanced by another Rs 3000 crore at the revised estimate stage, as originally envisaged by the Department of Space.

The total cost of Gaganyaan -- which envisages sending a crew of astronauts to space and bring them back safely to earth before the 75th Independence Day (2022) -- as cleared by the union cabinet in December 2018, is Rs 10,000 crore.

Isro has already commenced on the hardware realization for ground test and first unmanned mission. Space flight training of four astronaut-elects has commenced in Russia, while the design, development and delivery of human centric products such as crew medical kit, crew health monitoring system, emergency survival kit, dosimeters, earmuffs and fire suppression system has started in collaboration with several national institutions.

Besides, a three-week training programme for flight surgeon was completed at Isro with participation of CNES, the French space agency. As TOI had reported last week, work on human rating is progressing as envisaged by Isro, and the agency has designed a new vehicle to test the crew escape system.

Besides, Isro has planned a series of tests before the first of the two unmanned flights scheduled for end of 2020. Also, Isro has shortlisted four biological and two physical science related microgravity experiments for the unmanned mission of Gaganyaan.

Further, the panel points out that while the department of space had projected a demand of Rs 24,686 crore for 2020-21, it has only been allocated Rs 13,479 crore, which is about 55% of what the department had asked for.

""It has been brought to the notice of the Committee that the department has accordingly re-prioritised its programmes. Secretary, Department of Space assured the Committee that the on-going programmes will not be affected and that it would seek additional funds at supplementary demand for grants stage,"" the panel report reads.",2020-03-08T05:47:00Z
The Times of India,Gujarat: Nayara Energy's expansion plans face green challenge | Ahmedabad News - Times of India,,"AHMEDABAD: Rosneft-backed Nayara Energy's (formerly known as Essar Oil) plans for expansion of the existing refinery and setting up a new petrochemical complex at Vadinar near Jamnagar seems to have hit a hurdle after some villagers alleged that the company did not follow due process to get environmental clearance.

Nayara Energy's expansion plan includes setting up a 10.75 million metric tonnes per annum (MMTPA) capacity petrochemical complex and expansion of the refinery from 20 MMTPA to 46 MMTPA for a total investment of about Rs 1.3 lakh crore.

A clutch of people from villages including Gagva, Khavdi, Meghpar, Padana, Jakhar, Vadinar, Timbdi, Devadiya and Lakhiya objected to grant of clearance by the Ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC) on the grounds that a public hearing was not held, said Dilipsinh Jadeja who filed a petition in the Gujarat high court. He is a resident of a village near the Nayara's project.

The environment appraisal committee (EAC) under MoEFCC deferred the matter after it was approached by the company for environmental clearance, according to an interim order passed by the high court recently. The court order cites the statement of the senior counsel of the respondent which says that the expert appraisal committee is to convene a meeting between February 25 to February 27 but has deferred grant of environment clearance for Nayara's expansion plans.

Jadeja said that the company's plans for expansion in Jamnagar was earlier on the agenda of the EAC for February 26 but now stands deferred.

In August last year, a public consultation was held over grant of environmental clearance to Nayara's proposed expansion plans. Local villagers and others to be affected by the project were required to send responses in writing to Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) member secretary till August 5. GPCB forwarded the responses to the MoEFCC for consideration of grant of EC, a government source said. This was perhaps the first time that GPCB chose the public consultation route instead of a public hearing, sources added.

""There are legal guidelines that needs to be adhered to while granting environmental clearance. These rules have been grossly violated in this case. Such projects always require public hearing and it can't be through public consultation,"" said Jadeja.

In August 2017, a Rosneft-led consortium acquired Essar Oil for $12.9 billion and it was later renamed Nayara Energy.

""Environmental clearance for the Vadinar project was valid till 2018. However, the proposed expansion was not carried out in the stipulated time-frame by the earlier promoters. The new promoters have decided to scale down the project. Also, no additional land was required for the expansion, hence the public consultation route was chosen by GPCB,"" said a government official in the know of the matter.",2020-03-04T03:35:00Z
The Times of India,Patna University may sign MoU with IIPS to study Bihar's demography | Patna News - Times of India,,"PATNA: The Population Research Centre (PRC) of Patna University (PU) is likely to sign an MoU with the International Institute of Population Sciences (IIPS), Mumbai, for undertaking collaborative studies on demography. A proposal to this effect was advanced by PU vice-chancellor Rash Bihari Prasad Singh while addressing a three-day national seminar on 'Population, health and sustainable development goals: performance and prioritizing policies' jointly organized by IIPS and PU at Wheeler Senate House here on Thursday.

Singh said population issues assume greater significance to the modern societal development as the demography is likely to set the destiny of the 21st century India. Ever-increasing population along with the rising greed of human beings is creating imbalances in nature. Consequently, nature has started reacting adversely. We have already started facing the vagaries of nature in the shape of global warming, climate change, sea level rise, droughts and floods, he said.

Inaugurating the seminar, state education minister Krishna Nandan Prasad Verma said population explosion is proving to be the biggest bottleneck in way of national development and pleaded for effective steps to check its exponential growth. He said that even though Bihar was considered to be an educationally backward state, the Nitish government has, of late, initiated several steps to improve the literacy rate and bring back the dropouts to schools. Incentives were being provided to unmarried girls who pass Intermediate or graduation examination.

The minister said it has been observed that late marriage by educated boys and girls leads to family welfare and population control. The minister released the fact sheet of IIPS-sponsored project on 'Cause and consequences of out migration from middle Ganga plain'.

IIPS director K S James said the seminar would discuss among other issues the migration of people from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh and find ways to stop this ever-increasing problem. The seminar would also have a special session on health and environment wherein the experts would discuss in detail the effects of deteriorating environment on human health.

PU pro-VC Dolly Sinha said India's economy is heavily burdened with the mounting pressure of population explosion and no positive development is possible without have a check on population growth. It is a paradox that even though our country accounts for only 2.4% of the world's surface area, it has to support world's 17.5% population, she added.

""The packaging unit will be set up at Ekta Nursery at Kevadiya and will be run by Ekta Mahila Mandal Trust in association with Vadodara-based startup, Srishti Lifescience, said Pratik Pandya, deputy conservator of forests, Narmada, (social forestry).""

Besides reducing plastic menace, the glass bottle plant will be run exclusively by local tribal women, he said. The department is setting up the plant at a cost of Rs 15 lakh.

""Considering that every visitor consumes two litres of water during a day visit, 4.72 lakh bottles of one-litre single-use plastic bottles are being used every month. If a one such bottle contains 22 grams of plastic, a base estimate of 4.72 lakh plastic bottles will translate into generation of 10.384 tonnes of single-use plastic waste every month,"" an SoU official said.

Initially, the production capacity of the plant will be 3,000 bottles per day which will be ramped up to 14,000 daily soon.

""Consumers can return the empty bottles for an attractive buyback pricing or even choose to carry it home as SoU memoir. This initiative is our attempt to reduce carbon footprint and also eliminate the risk of micro-plastic intake by human beings,'' Prateek Patel, founder of Srishti Lifescience, told TOI.

According to an estimate, over 28 lakh visited SoU in the last 13 months.

Bottles will be available in one litre and 500 ml while the prices are yet to be fixed.",2020-02-12T00:30:00Z
The Times of India,CSE honours 172 schools with Climate Change Awards for 2019 under Green Schools Programme - Times of India,Neel Kamal,"BATHINDA: The Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) on Thursday gave away Green Schools Programme(GSP)Awards to schools from across the country who undertake a rigorous environmental audit exercise to minimise their resource footprints. The schools from Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh made a mark in different categories.

The audit has six sections: air, energy, food, land, water and waste -- together they aim at providing a holistic picture of resource efficiency. Through awareness on carbon emissions, clean sources of energy, food consumption, biodiversity, rainwater harvesting and segregation of waste, the audit paves the path for schools to combat climate change at the local level and progress towards transforming into a sustainable campus. The 172 made it to the roll of honours out of 1704 schools which sent complete reports.

The data that has emerged after the 2018-19 audit shows that 82 per cent of the schools that submitted the audit report segregate waste at source and ban selling of packaged foods in the school premises, 48 per cent practice rainwater harvesting, 12 per cent are using alternate sources of energy. Those schools that have monitored their resource use over the years and made significant improvements to move towards an efficient manner of functioning are termed as changemaker schools. Shivalik Valley School, Solan, Himachal Pradesh, Govt Sr Sec School Chail, Himachal Pradesh figured in list of changemaker schools.

Those that have managed to sustain their green performance for three or more years while continuously moving towards more sustainable means by being environmentally-astute are termed green in a row schools and Bal Bharati Public School, IMT Manesar, Haryana, Motilal Nehru School of Sports, Rai, Haryana figured in the category.

Govt Sr Sec School, Kujji, Himachal Pradesh figured in new entrant category where schools have participated in the audit for the first time and shown tremendous potential.

Kendriya Vidyalaya, Fatehgarh Sahib, Punjab remained the topper in energy section and Govt High School Dugha Himachal Pradesh topped in land section.

CSE director general Sunita Narain, who gave away awards at Delhi on Thursday, said ""Green Schools Programme was launched some years ago by CSE to initiate and strengthen the tools of ecological literacy in schools. It aims to support and hand-hold schools in the country to enable them to transition to greener infrastructure and practices.""

Says Ranjita Menon, programme director, environment education, CSE ""GSP audit exercise provides students the opportunity to minimise the usage of resources within the school premises and opens up avenues for activity-based environment education."" GSP programme has been able to bring about measurable practice changes in schools including increase in water table, reduced electricity bills through energy conservation and gradual shift to renewable energy, segregation of waste at source, increased green cover, move to sustainable modes of transport.",2020-02-06T16:04:00Z
The Times of India,Gujarat's chemical sector going full throttle | Ahmedabad News - Times of India,,"Ahmedabad: If environment clearances (EC) granted to companies for their projects are anything to go by, Gujarat will witness a flurry of fresh investments in the chemicals sector, especially agrochemicals and their intermediates.

As many as 20 chemical companies have received a green signal from Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) for their projects in Gujarat over the past three months alone. The estimated cost of these projects is upwards of Rs 3,000 crore.

Companies to have received a go-ahead for their projects include names like Bharat Rasayan Ltd, Cheminova India Ltd, Tagros Chemical India, Neogen Chemicals Ltd, Meghmani Organics Ltd and Insecticides India Ltd to name a few.

Denmark's Cheminova was granted EC early this month for expanding its pesticides and pesticide specific intermediate manufacturing capacity at its plant located in Panoli, Ankleshwar. According to MoEFCC notification, the cost of project is around Rs 790 crore. Neogen Chemicals Ltd's Rs 150 crore project for setting up fine chemicals and agro intermediates unit at Vagra in Bharuch also got the go-ahead.

Bharat Rasayan Limited (BRL), the flagship company of agrochemicals major Bharat group, plans to set up a new manufacturing facility for agrochemicals and their intermediates at Sayakha GIDC industrial estate at Vagra in Bharuch district. The project cost is Rs 310 crore.

The expansion and new projects receiving clearances in recent months are for agrochemicals, pesticides, dyes and intermediates and other chemicals. Majority of fresh investment is for expanding existing capacity of pesticides and adding new pesticide products.

""Agrochemicals is one business where there is a lot of supply coming from China to the rest of the world. In the last year or so, more and more European and American companies have begun looking towards India, for active ingredients which go into making insecticides, weedicides, herbicides. The world is now looking a little more on India than depending on China alone,"" said Deepak Mehta, chairman, National Chemicals Committee, FICCI.

Industry players opine that the exports of pesticides from India has seen a strong growth over the last few years. Domestic demand too is growing. The gap between demand and availability of agrochemical, pesticide, insecticide, intermediate and formulation is likely to increase over the years. This calls for such projects which can help in bridging the gap.

""Apart from domestic market, there is a sizeable demand for agrochemicals in the international market, which is prompting companies to diversify into this sector,"" added Mehta.

""Several companies are ramping up manufacturing capacities for basic chemicals such as sulphuric acid and caustic alkalies. There is a good demand for such products in both domestic and international market,"" Shailesh Patwari, past president, Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry (GCCI).",2020-01-26T03:52:00Z
The Times of India,Dyers hail NGT decision against environment ministry | Ludhiana News - Times of India,,"Ludhiana: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has ruled in favour of Punjab Dyers Association (PDA) in a petition in which the association had questioned the decision of the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change (MoEF) for discharging of water after treating it in the common effluent treatment plant (CETP).

A few days ago, the ministry had set up a new condition for releasing Rs15 crore subsidy to PDA for Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) at Tajpur Road under which PDA was asked to make a canal system of their own for discharging of water after treating it in the CETP. The PDA had filed a petition before the NGT, challenging this order.

PDA president Bobby Jindal said, ""It's a landmark verdict, and it will clear the decks for the completion of CETP at Tajpur Road which has remained pending for a long time due to one or the other hurdles being created either by the state government or the central government. We are thankful to NGT for taking the right decision and striking off this arbitrary condition laid by MoEF, which was totally unjustified.""

Jindal also added that a few years ago, when CETP at Focal Point was to be constructed, the member-secretary of Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) had himself submitted on behalf of the Punjab government that the government would make a canal system for CETPs and sewage treatment plants (STP) in the state for discharge and treatment of effluents. ""This point was put forward by us in NGT during the hearing, which was well accepted by the bench, and the verdict was ruled in our favour,"" he said.

In a related development for setting up of a CETP at Tajpur, the MoEF had shot off a letter to Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) to release a grant of Rs7.5 crore to PDA for this CETP, so that MoEF could also release a subsidy of Rs15 crore to PDA as per NGT orders. This development took place after PDA had alleged that the PPCB was not releasing its share of the Rs15-crore subsidy, despite repeated reminders by PDA.",2020-01-22T02:14:00Z
The Times of India,"Nuclear plant expansion: NGT issues notice to Centre, NPCIL | Hubballi News - Times of India",,"KARWAR: A National Green Tribunal (NGT) bench of south zone in Chennai on Thursday issued notice to the Centre and Nuclear Power Corporation of India (NPCIL) on a plea questioning environmental clearance to the expansion of Kaiga Atomic Power Project in Uttara Kannada district.

A joint appeal by Kaiga Anuvidyut Sthawarad Ghataka Virodhi Horata Samiti, Kadra Anekattina Nirashrtar Sangha and Kaiga Kali Santrastara Sangha said the clearance by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change disregarded adverse impact on the eco-sensitive Western Ghats. They pointed out that the clearance was against the NGT's previous orders for maintaining the eco-sensitive zone of Western Ghats. The clearance was granted to expand the capacity of Kaiga Units 5 and 6 from 235 MWe to 700 MWe each.

""The clearance has not taken into account the adverse environmental impact likely to be caused as a result of laying down of 100-km long power transmission lines on a 75-meter wide corridor through the dense tropical forests of the Western Ghats surrounding the project site, which are in an eco-sensitive zone,"" the petitioners said.",2019-12-20T03:44:00Z

In its latest order, NGT's principal bench in New Delhi, said that if there is further default and delay beyond March 31, 2020, ""we may have to direct that the advisor, ESZ (eco-sensitive zone) division, not be entitled to salary till compliance and that the draft notification be deemed to be final from April 1, 2020"".

""Having regard to the earlier delay and violation of undertaking given to this tribunal and the need for speedy finalisation of the notification, the ongoing proceedings cannot be unending and need to be suitably curtailed"", the tribunal said. The order was passed on a application made by Goa Foundation on the grounds that the ministry had failed to adhere to the timeline given earlier by the tribunal for the finalisation of the draft. The delay is also because some states want more areas to be excluded from ESZ.

Advisor of ESZ division, Moefcc, who was present in person stated that the matter is being processed and will be positively finalised before March 31, 2020.",2019-11-28T02:19:00Z

In its order dated November 21, the tribunal said, ""Considering the fact that EC is necessary, which was also our prima facie view held earlier, we direct the respondent industry to stop its activities until clarification is received from the ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC).""

The NGT order comes after an application was filed by an activist from Mundra, Gajendra Singh Jadeja, and other villagers in July this year. The investment in the project is expected to be in the range of Rs 6,000 crore to Rs 8,000 crore.

They had earlier complained to various state and central authorities in July 2018 claiming that the company had started construction without environment clearance as mandated under the Environment Impact Assessment Notification 2006, said advocate Sankar Pani who appeared on behalf of Singh and the others.

""No action was initiated, and the company was given a free hand to set up the unit fully. Hence, we approached the NGT Pune bench in July this year,"" he said.

The company is in the process of setting up a steel rolling mill unit with a capacity of 7 lakh tons per annum on an area of 213 hectares (ha) between Ratadiya and Kundrodi villages in Mundra block, according to Pani. Further hearing on the matter is to be held on January 14, 2020.

According to the company's website, Chromeni Steels is a joint venture between Tsinghan Industries of China and four Indian partners. The ground-breaking ceremony of the manufacturing plant was done by Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani on January 23, 2018, it says. The company is aiming to achieve a production capacity of 1 million tonnes per year for cold-rolled foils by December 2019 and add another 1 million by 2022 apart from 4 million tonnes of hot-rolled foils by 2025.

Earlier this year, the decks were cleared for the company to receive incentives under the state government's Ultra Mega and Mega Scheme.

The Times of India,Little Theatre's Christmas Pantomime to present protesting spinach | Chennai News - Times of India,,"CHENNAI: December is just around the corner. With the Christmas season in Chennai comes The Little Theatre's celebrated Patomime.

As youth across the world challenge climate change head-on, the 25th edition of the Christmas Pantomime is set in the year 1920. The Amazon forest has burned and the earth's oxygen supply is dropping dangerously low.

Two spinach farmers - Popaii and Bluto - are in the middle of a crisis as their spinach protest and refuse to grow without fresh oxygen. Their lady love Olive too will only marry the more successful farmer.

As Popaii and Bluto fight for her, they have a common enemy to confront - Villain Melon Musk and his gang of pirates who steal their oxygen and kidnap Olive. Also part of the action is Dame Oil, who lives on the island of Hawaii and conceals the secret that will regrow the Amazon.

With all this and more 'Popaii in Hawaii' promises to be a memorable evening with foot-stamping music and songs.

Directed by Krishnakumar B, with choreography by Vikas Rao and music by Lavita Lobo, it will be performed at Museum Theatre in Egmore from December 13 to 18.

The Times of India,Gene pool to preserve Kutch's indigenous dates | Rajkot News - Times of India,,"Rajkot: Date Palm Research Centre (DPRC) in Mundra has set up India's first field gene bank with an aim to preserve the famed Kutchi dates.

Kutch is the biggest date palm producer in India and according to latest figures, the region produces 1.80 lakh tonnes dates annually.

The cultivation is spread on 17,000 hectares. However, rapid industrialization, pollution and climate change pose a potential threat to several varieties and agriculture scientists fear that these may get extinct if not preserved properly through genetic engineering.

The 1998 Kandla cyclone had ravaged thousands of date palms across Kutch. Moreover, the rapid industrialization in Kutch in last two decades has resulted in vast tracts of agriculture land getting converted into the industrial zones.

Talking to TOI, CM Muralidharan, research scientist at DPRC, said, ""The number of date varieties is vast. We have already created clones of 200 varieties over the last three years and are adding more varieties. We identify the varieties that are strong and clone them.""

Kutch produces dates that are red, yellow and green and there are various sizes of the fruit too.

During the process of cultivation, scientists identify certain rare characters in plants which are rare but natural and that can be used in future genetic engineering. In future, they can even create a total new variety from the gene bank using biotechnology.",2019-11-17T00:15:00Z
https://www.hindustantimes.com/,"Elevated corridor, meant to unclog Ring Road, gets Yamuna agency's nod - cities - Hindustan Times",,"New Delhi: The Public Works Department (PWD)'s project to construct an elevated corridor between Signature Bridge and Delhi Noida Direct (DND) Flyway, parallel to the Yamuna, to decongest the busy Ring Road has got the much-awaited nod from the Yamuna standing committee -- the body that clears projects being taken up on the riverbed.

The committee, however, mentioned that the PWD will have to get mandatory clearances from the National Green Tribunal (NGT), ministry of environment & forest and climate change (MoEF&CC) and the Delhi Development Authority (DDA).

""After detailed discussion, the committee said it has no objections to the proposal from the flood point of view subject to the following conditions: Physical model study for the project may be carried out by CWPRS (Central Water and Power Research Station), Pune, at the time of formulation of detailed project report to assess adverse effects, if any,"" minutes of the meeting, accessed by HT, read.

The PWD, after completing a detailed feasibility study, had in June submitted the project to the Yamuna standing committee for its approval.

The project was announced by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia in March 2018. The project envisages the construction of a 22km long elevated corridor, connecting Signature Bridge with DND Flyway to reduce the travel time between these points from the current one hour to 30 minutes.

The PWD has also made a slight change in the alignment as the earlier plan included use of Salimgarh bypass -- a stretch of the Ring Road passing via Salimgarh Fort and IP Flyover.

The changes in the plan were made on the suggestions of PWD minister Satyendar Jain, who during a presentation, pointed out that the Ring Road is already congested and so there was no point of using the bypass stretch in the new project.

The Ring Road is used by around 1.5 lakh passenger car units (PCU) per day. PCU is a metric used by transportation engineers to assess traffic flow rate on a highway.

""Now that Salimgarh bypass road is not part of the plan, the entire corridor will be elevated between the Signature Bridge and DND Flyway,"" a senior PWD official, requesting anonymity, said.

The officials say the nod from the Yamuna standing committee was one of the major hurdles, which has been cleared. It project will now be sent to the Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning & Engineering) Centre (UTTIPEC) -- the apex body which okays all infrastructure projects in Delhi -- for a formal approval.

""Since the project has been cleared by the Yamuna standing committee, the chances of it being stopped by other agencies are slim. We will send the project to UTTIPEC next month,"" the official said.

According to PWD officials, this elevated corridor will serve as an alternative route to the Ring Road, which will run parallel to Yamuna and will connect around seven road bridges on the river.

Quoting an example, the official said that after the completion of elevated corridors and flyovers between Vikaspuri and Wazirabad, the entire stretch of Outer Ring Road has become signal free. As result, this has led to heavy congestion at Majnu Ka Tila T-junction and Metcalf House T-junction. The Signature bridge traffic is also contributing to this congestion.

The cost fixation of the project is yet to be done, but the PWD officials estimate it to be around ₹3,000 crore. The construction will be completed in 2.5 years from the date of starting work on ground.

Sewa Ram, professor of transport planning at School of Planning and Architecture (SPA), said as the Ring Road is already clogged, the construction of such alternative route is necessary.

""It seems to be an ambitious project as it would unclog the Ring Road but the authorities will have to ensure that the corridor has controlled access and is mainly used by end-to-end traffic otherwise it would become like any other clogged road.

He said the new road's entry and exit points will also have to be designed meticulously to avoid confusion.

Double decker sections planned

The project also envisages the construction of two decks at certain locations.The second deck will be constructed three metres below the main traffic carrying deck. The engineers said the cumulative length of the double decker corridor will be 6km.

""The traffic will move on the upper deck while the lower deck will serve as an observatory corridor for the riverfront being developed by the DDA. This deck can be used by pedestrians to enjoy the riverfront as well as by e-rickshaws, cycles and cycle-rickshaws,"" a PWD official said.

The double decker sections will be between Signature Bridge and Yudhister Setu (Kashmere Gate), along Salimgarh bypass, between Indraprastha Station and NH-24 crossing.",2019-11-09T00:47:00Z
The Times of India,"In Assam jungles, 'Laden' strikes terror | Guwahati News - Times of India",,"GUWAHATI: "" Have they got Laden?"" said one man. "" Not yet, but the officers are armed and ready,"" replied another.

Osama bin Laden may have been killed by US Navy SEALs eight years ago, but his name keeps cropping up in parts of Assam. Except that the Laden in question here is not the chief of the dreaded terrorist organization al-Qaeda but a lone wandering elephant that killed five people in a single night in Goalpara district last week. A team of eight officers is on its tracks - aided by a drone which has already sighted the elephant in Satabari reserve forest- aiming to tranquilize and translocate the pachyderm before it strikes again.

The residents, meanwhile, are forced to live in fear as Assam struggles with a 'jumbo' problem. At least 57 people have been killed in elephant attacks this year alone, according to the forest department. Data submitted in Lok Sabha in July this year by the ministry of environment, forests and climate change also showed that the number of deaths in elephant attacks in Assam far exceeds those from other states with a high elephant population.

While Assam has second-highest number of elephants at 5,719, according to the 2017 elephant population estimation carried out in 23 states, Karnataka has the highest elephant population at 6,049. In Assam, 86 people were killed in elephant attacks in 2018-19, 83 died in 2017-18 and 136 people were killed in 2016-17. In Karnataka, 13 people perished in elephant attacks in 2018-19, 23 in 2017-18 and 38 in 2016-17.

In Goalpara's Matia where five people were killed on October 29 by an elephant, now named Laden, residents find it difficult to sleep peacefully. ""We wake up at the slightest sound. We have to be on constant vigil with our torches and firecrackers ready to ward off the animals,"" said Prafulla Kalita, a school teacher in Goalpara's Matia. The sentiment is echoed by Tirtha Lochan Roy, who works as a bicycle repairer, and whose house was damaged thrice by rampaging elephants between 2016 and 2018.

Such is the terror that elephants have wreaked in Assamese villages that the moniker 'Laden' has attached itself to jumbos that stealthily sneak into farms to raid crops and attack farmers. Honorary wildlife warden, Kaushik Baruah, said that the name came into use when an elephant killed a dozen people in several villages across Sonitpur district in 2006, a time when Osama Bin Laden was frequently in the news. The elephant was shot down later that year and his human namesake in 2011.

But an important realisation had dawned on people of Sonitpur and elsewhere - the conflict got more attention than it otherwise would have because al-Qaeda chief's name was attached to it. This had made it easier for them to get authorities to act and also to claim compensation in case of damage.

In the following years, every conflict-ridden district had its own Laden. But eliminate one tormentor and another would storm into the scene.",2019-11-08T08:54:00Z
The Times of India,How women of Nagaland village are corralling climate change | Kohima News - Times of India,,"CHIZAMI (NAGALAND): Standing in a terraced paddy field, arms and legs coated in mud, Wetezou points to a barren area some 100 metres away and says: ""The entire area used to be wet-terraced field, but has now become dry terrace. We plant vegetables there.""

The concern in the voice of the 53-year-old farmer in Chizami is echoed in the words of every cultivator in this Nagaland village.

Lhikowe-u, 39, sits in the community shed of her clan after a hard day's work on her fields and explains how farming has undergone a sea change in the last two decades because of pest infestations and unpredictable rainfall pattern.

Like most parts of the state, Phek district - where Chizami is located - also suffered an attack by the fall armyworm pest this year. ""We do not know what is wrong with the rains. At times, even proper rains aren't helping the crops,"" ruminates Lhikowe-u, who became a fulltime farmer after her marriage at 17.

Vagaries of climate are a big factor behind fertile lands rendered fallow. ""Due to climate change, water in streams have reduced and aren't reaching all the fields. Nearly a third of our agricultural land is not being cultivated,"" Welhite Naro, Chizami village council chief, says.

A climate of change

Combined with the problem of men keeping off the fields and switching to cash crops, instead, erratic and scanty rainfall in recent years is posing fresh challenge to women farmers here.

But the women of Chizami, under the guidance of North East Network (NEN), have found strength in their farmers' collective and are showing a way forward to not just the state, but the whole of northeast. It is a model village, where women fought for eight years and in 2015 won the right to pay parity with men for non-specialised work.

NEN, a non-profit organization has been working in Nagaland for the last 21 years to promote women's rights.

""There's exposure because of NEN. We are applying what we learn at seminars and workshops and share the knowledge among ourselves. We are now growing beans round the year. We are sowing a variety of crops at different times of the years to beat weather extremities,"" Lhikowe-u says.

The women of Chizami have organized themselves and started a seed bank to support farmers when crops fail. The bank, set up in 2018, has 226 varieties of seeds with 35 types of paddy and seven types of foxtail millet stored in neatly arranged bamboo hollows and baskets and dried gourd shells. If a farmer takes a cob of maize or a cup of some seeds, he or she must return double the amount a year later. Members of the village women's society maintain a logbook accounting for all the borrowing and lending.

""We are witnessing erratic climate conditions and pest attacks. The seed bank will provide food security to us.

With it, even in times of crop washouts, we won't lose out completely,"" says Adele, secretary of the village development board (VDB).

The seed bank promotes indigenous paddy varieties that are sturdier and resilient to extreme weather conditions. ""We have exchanged seeds with farmers from states like Meghalaya and Telangana too,"" Adele says.

A variety of pearl millet the women got from Hyderabad is growing well here.

Future tense

Today, the burden of cultivating food crops for sustenance has fallen upon the women.

""Increasingly, men have moved away from the arduous job of cultivating traditional crops. They prefer to earn as manual labourers in construction work, or just idle away their time playing chess and Ludo,"" Wetezou says.

""Men who have studied till higher secondary don't want to return to the fields, but they aren't even finding jobs,"" she says.

Working in the fields is laborious and men have been shirking ploughing and helping women with harvesting, their traditional roles. Not just that, men -- the primary owners of land in patriarchal Naga society -- are increasingly diverting their land for cash crops, which don't need to be planted annually.

""I have kiwi, cardamom, and plum plantations for cash returns to help me manage the education of my sons,"" Naro, the village council head, says.

The 60-year-old, who has a master's in sociology from Jamia University in Delhi, acknowledges that land is being diverted to cash crops and says it is mostly to fund the education of children. But with the switch to cash crops, access of women to land for food crops is reducing.

The future looks grim. Today, women have access to community land through their fathers, brothers, and husbands. But, increasingly, land is being privatized and going into the hands of a few.

Wekoweu Tsuhah, the programme director of NEN in Nagaland, says this will jeopardise the security of single women in villages. ""In 10 to 15 years, only afew individuals and families will control land. More trees are being planted for cash and landowners won't allow women access to those land,"" Tsuhah says.

For now, women are controlling food crops and feeding their families. They are also diversifying into vegetables and cereals like millets.

""Foxtail millet fetch Rs100 a kg and women are earning cash from cereals and vegetables they grow. They are taking decisions on the fields and getting more say in their family and in society now,"" Naro says.

For now, the crowning glory is the village council of Chizami, the apex decision-making body, with two women among its six members -- a huge stride in a patriarchal society where women were denied leadership roles for centuries.",2019-09-28T06:09:00Z
The Times of India,Bihar: 21 IFS officers attend training programme at DMI | Patna News - Times of India,,"PATNA: Deputy chief minister (CM) Sushil Kumar Modi (SuMo) on Monday asked forest officers to be proactive while interacting with the media.

""Even smaller accomplishments need to be brought to the notice of the media for wider circulation,"" SuMo said while inaugurating a five-day training programme on 'Art of Interacting with Print and Electronic Media' organized by Development Management Institute (DMI) on Monday.

Sponsored by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, the programme was attended by 21 officers of the Indian Forest Service from different parts of the country.

The deputy CM asked officials of the state environment, forest and climate change department to form a media cell. He said, ""Mediapersons are your friends and their criticism should be used in a positive manner to improve yourself.""

SuMo also asked the Bihar government to conduct similar training programmes for officials of the state forest department and the local mediapersons. He said, ""The department will provide information about its rules, laws and new guidelines to the journalists so that there is factual and correct reporting.""

Principal chief conservator of forests, S S Chaudhary, was also present at the training session as the guest of honour. He pointed out, ""Although the forest cover in Bihar is less compared to its neighbouring states, more trees have been planted over the last few years here.""

DMI dean Niraj Kumar said, ""This is for the first time that a training session on such an important subject is being organized for forest officers in the state. There will be a mock press conference on the last day of the programme where they will learn the nuances of media engagement.""

DMI director Hemnath Rao H welcomed the participants and said forest officers needed to be extra careful because of the accountability and responsibility they held.",2019-09-17T09:33:00Z
The Times of India,ADA stops construction of houses under PM Awas Yojana | Agra News - Times of India,,"Agra: The Agra Development Authority (ADA) has informed the central government that it will not be able to construct houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna (PMAY) in the eco-sensitive Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ) owing to a ban imposed by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change on construction activities within 5,000 square metres.

The TTZ is a defined area of 10,400 sq km around the Taj Mahal to protect the monument from pollution. It covers five districts in the Agra region and comprises over 40 protected monuments, including the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri.

""Due to ad hoc moratorium imposed by the environment ministry, construction of houses under the PMAY scheme could not take place. Following approval of higher authorities, we have asked the central government to cancel the assigned target. We have proposed to re-assign the target for construction of houses after the ad hoc moratorium is removed,"" ADA secretary RP Tripathi said.

Meanwhile, four private builders, who entered into a contract with the ADA to build houses, have sought s refund of their security money, sources privy to the development told TOI.

In November 2018, when the target for construction of houses was assigned to ADA, the environment ministry had placed ban on construction activities on 20,000 square meters around the Taj Mahal.

But later, the ad hoc moratorium was made applicable on construction activites within 5000 square meteres.",2019-09-05T06:18:00Z
The Times of India,Warming Arabian sea burns coral colour | Ahmedabad News - Times of India,,"AHMEDABAD: Coral reefs -- the marine wonders that leave us awestruck by their rockpools of colour -- are under climate threat. A recent study, published in the reputed science journal Current Science, shows that they are slowly bleaching away on the Gujarat's Gulf of Kutch shores.

A major reason is the frequent 'ocean heat waves' or thermal stress owing to climate change, coupled with anthropological issues.

Bleaching means the change in colour of the corals because of the decay in algae living in their tissues as symbiotic partners.

The algae is also the reason that gives the corals their distinct colour. As sea temperature rises above normal summer maxima the corals are forced to expel the algae and turn white. These bleached corals thereafter get prone to disease and ultimately die.

A study undertaken by Isro's Space Applications Centre (SAC) research team and the department of geophysics, Kurukshetra University analysed sea surface temperatures (SST) from 1982 has reported increased number of heat stress days. The study includes three distinct years of 'Mass Coral Bleaching' (MCB) instances of 1998, 2010 and 2016 recorded during the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) that caused abrupt rise in sea temperature. The thermal stress of 2010 was the worst for corals of Gulf of Kutch coasts, when mass bleaching occurred.

The data reveals that extremely sensitive carbonate reef structures are commonly built up in tropical regions where sea water temperatures exceed 18 degree Celsius during winter and remains below 28 degree Celsius in summer.

However, in 1998, the Isro-SAC study found that the SST exceeded to 29.58 degree Celsius. Also, against the ideal span of 28 days, the number of heat stress days stood at 37. In 2010 SST went up to 30.44 degree Celsius, while the total heat stress days rose to 91 days. During the 2016 temperature went up to 29.91 degree Celsius while the number of heat stress days stood at 70.

Changing hues

Bleaching means change in colour of corals because of decay in algae living in their tissues as symbiotic partners. Algae is also the reason the corals get their colour. As sea temperature rises above normal summer maxima, corals expel the algae and turn white. These bleached corals then get prone to disease and die. Normally, corals can re-establish themselves in a decade or two

13 coral species had bleached in 70 days

Normally corals can re-establish themselves (or return to their pre-bleaching state) in a decade or two. ""But the quick frequency and intensity of MCB overwhelms the coral reefs ability to recover from heat stress episodes,"" the study says.

The study utilized data from US-based National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and corroborates findings of Suganthi Devadason Marine Research Institute, Tuticorin on the bleaching of corals of the Gulf of Kutch.

The study undertaken in 2016 found 13 of the total 37 coral species had bleached during the 70 days of prolonged heat stress.

The Times of India,Bihar CM Nitish Kumar asks babus to harvest rainwater at office buildings | Patna News - Times of India,,"PATNA: Chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar on Friday asked all senior bureaucrats to develop rainwater harvesting system at their office buildings and set an example for common people to follow.

The CM was addressing a large gathering of government officers, peoples' representatives, schoolchildren and women members of 'Jeevika' at the Bapu Sabhagar here after inaugurating a statewide awareness programme on his government's 'Jal-Jivan-Hariyali (JJH) Abhiyan', which is aimed at protecting environment and mitigating the challenges posed by climate change across the globe.

""You people do it (rainwater harvesting) first at your office buildings. Common people will follow it,"" Nitish told the state government officers. A large number of senior officers of Indian Administrative Service, Indian Police Service and Indian Forest Service were present at the meeting.

Highlighting the importance of the JJH Abhiyan, which would be formally launched on the Independence Day, the CM said 'jivan' (life) on this Earth could be saved only if there is enough water and greenery. ""That is why we have kept 'jal' (water) at one side of the 'jivan' and 'hariyali' on another side while naming the Abhiyan to signify the importance of water and greenery in people's lives,"" he said.

Highlighting the importance of ponds, wells and other water bodies in maintaining level of groundwater, the CM said his government would soon launch a special drive across the state to free all public water bodies from illegal encroachments.

He called upon the people to plant at least one sampling around their homes and take necessary steps to protect trees. ""Lack of trees means less rainfall,"" Nitish said pointing out how clouds hover over the state capital but rain does not happen.

He also called for installation of solar plates on all government buildings to popularise solar energy.

""Till the date I am at the helm of affairs in the state, there will be no negligence in implementation of the JJH Abhiyan because serving people is my religion,"" the CM said.

He called upon people's representatives from all political parties, elected members of urban local bodies (ULBs) and panchayati raj institutions (PRIs) to extend their full cooperation in propagating the Abhiyan.

The CM also released the logo of the Abhiyan on the occasion. Two short films on issues related to environment were shown.

Earlier, the CM administered an 11-point pledge about protecting environment to all people present in the hall.

The CM's vision speech on the Abhiyan was live telecast and webcast in all 534 block headquarters and 38 district headquarters.",2019-08-10T01:42:00Z
The Times of India,Kosi-Mechi linking project gets Centre's green signal | Patna News - Times of India,,"PATNA: The plan to link Kosi and Mechi rivers -- the second river-linking project in the country after the Ken-Betwa scheme in Madhya Pradesh -- has got the green clearance from the Centre.

The Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change on Thursday gave its nod to the state's Kosi-Mechi river linking (KMRL) project, paving the way for work to begin next year, sources in the state water resources department said.

To be undertaken at a cost of around Rs 4,900 crore, the KMRL project is likely to be completed in five years. Once completed, it will irrigate 2.14 lakh hectares in four Seemanchal -- 59,970 hectares in Araria, 59,642 hectares in Purnia, 39,548 hectares in Kishanganj, and 35,635 in Katihar district of Purnia division.

A 76.2km canal will be built to link the two rivers basins of Kosi (Supaul and Saharsa districts) in the west with Mechi basin in Kishananj on the east, and their linkage with the Mahananda basin, further east.

An elated state water resources minister Sanjay Kumar Jha tweeted on Friday night: ""Bihar's ambitious Kosi-Mechi river linking project all set to go on floor! Delighted to share the news of grant of formal approval by @efcc.""

""The last techno-admin clearance required! The 4900 cr project will provide irrigation to over 2.14 lakh hectares of land in 4 districts in Seemanchal,"" he added in a second tweet.

Jha had met Union forest minister Prakash Javadekar on June 17 this year seeking clearance for the project that had been pending with the Centre for the past few years.

Accordingly, the national water development authority provided statistical details required to give the clearance to the project. ""After this, the Union ministry gave its clearance. The KMRL project has sanction from all statutory bodies, like Central Water Commission and NWDA,"" a state water resources department official said.

However, the state will have to work out a way to generate the Rs 4,900 crore to fund the project. The state government has been canvassing with the Centre to declare the KMRL as a national project, as the irrigation envisaged is over 2 lakh hectares of land. If it is declared a national project, the Centre would bear 90% of the cost (or Rs 4,410) and the state government the remaining 10% (or Rs 490 crore). Such an arrangement will involve talks between PM Narendra Modi and CM Nitish Kumar.

Alternatively, the state government would have to raise the money from its own resources and through external borrowings, such as funding from the Asian Development Bank. Incidentally, at present, the Bihar Kosi Basin Development Project is being implemented with assistance from the World Bank.",2019-08-04T02:28:00Z
The Hindu,Unpredictable rains are a worry: IIT researchers,Vasanth Sundarrajan,"Kerala floods, T.N. water scarcity show vagaries of monsoon, say researchers from IIT Madras, Bombay

Researchers from IIT Madras and IIT Bombay have said the rains have grown more unpredictable than before, and this bodes ill for a country whose economic well-being is critically linked to seasonal rains.

A team of IIT Madras and IIT Bombay studied the rainfall pattern in India over the past century and published the results in the peer-reviewed journal Public Library of Science, a non-profit science, technology and medicine publisher based in San Francisco. The research delved into the impact of climate change on the temporal and spatial rainfall patterns through the analysis of historic data and simulation studies.

The team comprised Dr. Subimal Ghosh and Dr. Subhankar Karmakar from IIT Bombay, Dr. K.S. Kasiviswanathan, Dr. K.P. Sudhir and Dr. Sachin Gunthe from IIT Madras along with their research students. The research was supported by the Max Planck Partner Group at IIT Madras, Department of Science and Technology, Government of India, and the Ministry of Earth Sciences.

The researchers did not observe convection-based rains, which occur in areas where there is excess moisture. This is significant as it contradicts the traditional notion of dry areas becoming drier and wet areas becoming wetter in response to climate change.

Many recent observations both at the meteorological level and from local perceptions revealed that monsoon the has grown more unpredictable than before. The research said calamities such as the Kerala floods and water scarcity in Tamil Nadu bear testimony to the vagaries of the monsoon.

Dr. Gunthe of IIT Madras said, ""The regional aspects of the Indian summer monsoon rain pattern are difficult to understand because it is affected by many factors. In order to discern rainfall patterns reliably, we used the India Meteorological Department's daily rainfall data for 1901 to 2004 and performed simulations taking into consideration phenomena such as maximum temperature, minimum temperature, rainfall and wind velocity.""

Dr. Gunthe said the model was validated with satellite-based observation from the European Space Agency-Climate Change Initiative on soil moisture.",2019-07-25T20:15:00Z
The Times of India,"Rains to pick up in Mumbai today, wet weekend likely: IMD | Mumbai News - Times of India",,"MUMBAI: India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast heavy rains at isolated places in the city and suburbs for Wednesday. The wet spell is expected to continue till the weekend. Meanwhile, private weather forecasting agency, Skymet, has also said rainfall will pick up significantly after July 25.

As compared to the first few days of July which recorded very heavy rainfall, the past few days have been comparatively dry. The total rainfall recorded since June 1 by the IMD Colaba observatory has been 1,067.1 mm which is 21.6 mm below normal, while IMD Santacruz observatory has recorded1,462 mm which is 337.8 mm above normal. The onset of monsoon was declared on June 25, a considerable delay from its usual onset date of June 10.

Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology & climate change, Skymet, said westerly winds are expected to get stronger and, therefore, the intensity of rains may increase. ""We expect heavy rains on July 25-26.The monsoon surge is active over south Konkan and Goa, coastal Karnataka and Kerala. Already many parts, particularly Ratnagiri, Alibaug, have received extremely heavy rains. There is a cyclonic circulation persisting over north Konkan and adjoining north east Arabian Sea,"" said Palawat. Meanwhile, in the 12 hours on Tuesday, IMD Colaba observatory recorded 0.8mm and IMD Santacruz recorded 1.8mm rainfall.

Almost a week after the BMC withdrew its 10% water cut, there has not been any major increase in the water levels in the city's lakes. Tulsi, one of the smallest lakes supplying only 1% water to Mumbai, had overflowed on July 12. The total water quantum in the seven lakes stood at 7.85 lakh million litres or 54.24% on Tuesday. On July 19, when the water cut was withdrawn, the total water quantum stood at 7.4 lakh million litres or 51.4% of the city's requirement.

For the city to avoid water cut for the rest of the year, the total stock in all seven lakes should be 14.5 lakh million litres as on October 1.",2019-07-24T00:26:00Z

Of the total 6.3 km stretch between R-Block and Digha, the green belt zone will be developed between service lane and main road at a stretch of 4.2km, while the elevated road will be exempted. Under this project, the department has divided the green belt into three parts, i.e. from R-Block to Hartali Mor (1km), Visheshwarya Bhawan to Rajiv Nagar (1.5km) and Rajiv Nagar to Digha (1.7km).

Around 1,000 trees will be planted on R-Block- Digha four-lane road.

BSRCD managing director Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said that with the commencement of tree translocation, work for creating the green belt has already started. ""All 150 trees will be translocated on this green belt which is to be developed between service lane and main road. But since these trees will not be sufficient, we have planned to plant another 1,000 trees on the stretch,"" he said.

""The department will plant trees that have good growth and the growth will be monitored by the forest department. Since we don't have any green belt in city, it will be the first of its kind,"" Agrawal said.

He also added that the trees will not cause any obstruction in movement of vehicles. ""We have specifically kept such things in mind. Our aim is to create more greenery in the city,"" he said.

Meanwhile, the four-lane road will also be equipped with smart solar-enabled streetlights and have facilities of closed-circuit television cameras.",2019-07-22T07:03:00Z
The Times of India,Increase Bihar's green cover to fight global warming: Nitish Kumar | Patna News - Times of India,,"PATNA: Chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar on Saturday called upon the people to go for accelerated plantation drive in all the districts and help increase the green cover of the state to 17% of its total area as it is the safest way to mitigate the challenge of global climate change.

The CM was addressing lawmakers from the state assembly and legislative council at the central hall of the extended legislature building to inform them about the likely impact of climate change in the state over the next 30 years. He said ill effects of climate change became visible in the state in the last 13 years.

The CM said while the date of arrival of monsoon in the state is June 15, it generally gets delayed. ""The state's average rainfall has been at 900mm in the last 13 years, while the normal average rainfall in the state stood in the range of 1,200mm to 1,500mm. It has fallen to an average of 1,000mm in the last 30 years,"" the CM said.

The CM said after the separation of Jharkhand from Bihar in November 2000, the state was left with a hugely depleted green cover of around only 8%. ""In the last 15 years, 22 crore saplings were planted in various parts of the state. Today, the state's green cover is 15%, but it has to be increased to 17%, which is the desired national standard for any region,"" the CM said.

The CM appealed to the lawmakers to inform people in their constituencies about the critical situation triggered by global warming. ""Global warming is responsible for high temperature, extreme weather conditions, erratic rainfall, lightning and thunder, flood and drought, falling water table, drinking water crisis and air pollution,"" the CM said.

Nitish said heatstroke killed several people in the state this year, while the deaths of children due to acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in Muzaffarpur and other districts were also attributed to climate change.

The CM called for installation solar plates on the rooftops of government buildings for electricity, rainwater harvesting and proper use of water. He said farmers should desist from stubble burning in their fields as it causes air pollution and damages quality of soil.

State assembly Speaker Vijay Kumar Choudhary said campaign against climate change should be turned into a social movement.

A 15-minute documentary on climate change and its impact was also shown on the occasion. Energy department principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit conducted the proceedings. Officials from the disaster management, agriculture, water resources, public health and engineering, rural works and environment and forests and climate change departments presented their papers separately.",2019-07-14T06:38:00Z

Heavy rains are very likely in places at Palghar and Thane. From Thursday, light to moderate rain is forecast for the city and the adjoining areas for three days.

Heavy rain finally took a break on Tuesday, with light showers at isolated places balanced by the sun coming out in others despite a forecast of heavy to very heavy rain.

Private forecasting agency Skymet said rain activity is expected to increase slightly on Wednesday and stay till July 10. ""We expect the monsoon surge to increase a bit and there maybe a few moderate rain spells. We do not expect heavy to very heavy rains though,"" said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology & climate change, Skymet.

After warnings of heavy to very heavy rainfall (up to 200mm) from IMD -- shared widely on social media via a tweet by the @CPMumbaiPolice handle -- the 12 hours till 8.30pm on Tuesday saw only 2.2mm (light rain) in Santa Cruz. But Monday was a different story: in the 24 hours ending at 8.30am on Tuesday, Santa Cruz record 130.4mm of rain, which falls in the very heavy category.

Acting proactively on the heavy rain forecast, the number of traffic policemen on the streets was boosted on Tuesday. During a heavy downpour earlier this month, two motorists in a vehicle drowned in the waterlogged Malad subway. ""The increased police presence was keeping in mind the IMD warning. Also since a week, we have gone back to 12-hour work shifts,"" said joint commissioner, traffic, Madhukar Pandey.

""There was visible presence of traffic policemen on the streets. It helped clear congestion faster and kept traffic moving,"" said an Oshiwara resident.

Weathermen said monsoon has remained widespread and active over the entire Konkan belt, including Mumbai, with heavy rainfall over many places and isolated very heavy rainfall. Interior Maharashtra also received widespread rainfall.

About the dry weather in Mumbai of Tuesday, Palawat said there is no permanent weather system affecting Konkan and Goa and so the monsoon surge is weakening at times and strengthening at others.

""Between July 1-2, when Mumbai received extremely heavy rain, there was an active offshore trough right from south Gujarat to Karnataka coast and a cyclonic circulation was also near Konkan and Goa coast. This has now shifted towards south Gujarat and that is why the monsoon surge has weakened. But owing to strengthening of winds on Wednesday, we expect moderate spells,"" he said.",2019-07-10T01:49:00Z

The Times of India,"NGT seeks reports from Haryana, Delhi on wetland tag for Najafgarh - Times of India",Shilpy Arora,"Gurgaon: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has sought an action-taken reports from Delhi and Haryana governments over the declaration of wetlands in Najafgarh.

The directions were given after the Indian National Trust for Art & Cultural Heritage (INTACH) filed an execution application in the green tribunal, alleging the Haryana government has rolled out a proposal to build a bund (check dam) near Najafgarh lake to reclaim lands belonging to farmers, and is therefore backtracking from its stand to declare it a wetland.

""We filed an execution application as the state government has not done anything to notify the area around Najafgarh lake as a wetland. The proposed bund goes against the wetland notification. There is a need to understand that destruction of the wetland will have a major impact on Delhi-NCR's groundwater level, apart from destroying the ecology,"" said Manu Bhatnagar of INTACH.

In 2016, the state government had submitted a brief document (a copy is with TOI) in NGT and the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF&CC), stating that 120.80 hectare in Kherki Majra Dhankot near Najafgarh lake is a wetland and will be duly notified as such by the state government.

Environmentalists fear construction of a bund will contain the water and destroy the wetland, which serves as a habitat for several bird species and acts as a major groundwater recharge zone for Delhi and Gurgaon. ""The Haryana government is in a very tricky situation now, having itself committed in court and submitted in writing that it will notify Najafgarh as a wetland. Any proposal to build a bund now will destroy the wetland. However, the government can't backtrack from its stand any more, as it has submitted in writing that Najafgarh is a wetland,"" said Pankaj Gupta of NGO Delhi Bird Foundation.

In January, TOI reported that to woo voters in eight villages, the state government had proposed that villagers should sell their land to the government so that it can build a bund to protect their agricultural fields from flooding.

Farmers in the neighbouring villages claim that over 5,500 acre in eight villages -- Dharampur, Momdheri, Daultabad, Kherki Majra, Dhankot, Chandu, Budhera and Makrola -- remain flooded for most of the year, preventing them from cultivating the land.

As per an estimate, the 7km-long Najafgarh Jheel, located at the Delhi-Haryana border, has a potential to provide about 100 million litres of potable water a day to south-west Delhi and Gurgaon. The Najafgarh lake and drain are also the only outlets for floodwaters from Gurgaon. The lake and marshes have also been an important habitat for many plant species and hosts over 280 bird species, including greater flamingos, sarus cranes and greater white pelicans.",2019-04-06T02:36:00Z

Therefore, by the time it reaches your plate, it surely will be a 'hot delight'!

Bad weather and prolonged winter has delayed the delivery of mangoes by eight to 10 days this season. According to mango growers in Gir area this year the first fully ripen mangos will be seen in the market in the next 10 days. Further, the crop was also damaged because of unseasonal rain and heavy wind during January and February.

Jayesh Hirpra, a farmer of Javala near Talala in Gir Somnath district said, ""This year, climate change has affected the crop cuttin g production down by 20 to 25 percent than last year. Generally after March 15 we start selling our produce, but this year the crop is late and will start selling the fruit only from next week.""

Mango is cultivated in nearly 20,000 hectare area in Gir region. Gir Somnath, Junagadh and Amreli are the major districts that grow world famous kesar mango.

Farmers directly sell kesar mango in Ahmedabad for the past last couple of years under the banner of mango festival. The organizer Gir Krushi Vasant Producer Company Limited, which is registered as Farmers Producers Organization (FPO) is coming out with an innovative idea this year. It is planning to start selling mangoes in Ahmedabad from the second week of May, with an interesting twist.

Director of FPO, Bhagirath Damalia said, ""We are planning to use innovative marketing techniques this year where we will make the mango farmers from Gir brand ambassadors of their products and will chat with FM radio jockeys. We will make videos of the festival with sound byes of these farmers, their families and also customers and then upload it on Youtube. We will also do a Facebook live and engage our customers directly with the farmers through social media.""

The marketing techniques, training and resources will be provided by Gujarat Agribusiness Consortium Producers Company Ltd (GUJPRO). This company provides the farmers a platform in big cities like Ahmedabad. Last year the company helped farmers directly sell their kesar mangoes in Delhi.

The tribunal extended the time to prepare these coastal plans to August 31. It, however, ordered that further progress in the matter be brought on record by April 30 this year. The matter has now been fixed for hearing on May 9.

The tribunal's attention was drawn to the Supreme Court's order dated January 21 this year, allowing liberty to applicants to approach the NGT with prayers for relaxation of the stay order granted by the tribunal.

The tribunal's judges stated that the stay granted by it in its order dated November 22, 2017, was to the effect that environment clearance (EC) may not be granted till finalisation of coastal plans and that it was issued at the request of the MoEFCC.

On September 4 last year, the National Highways Authority of India had filed a miscellaneous application, wherein the tribunal directed the ministry to take a call in the matter as soon as the coastal plan was submitted.

In this application, the tribunal had noted that it had already directed that the CZMP be submitted to the MoEFCC by August 31, 2019.

Further, the tribunal held that it is for the state to submit the CZMP and that no further order was necessary at this stage. ""It is clear that the duration of stay is not for indefinite period and only till submission of CZMP by the state,"" the order states.

The tribunal added that the applicant is at liberty to move the state for expediting the process to submit the CZMP, as already observed, if such report has still not been submitted.

The issue of finalising the CZMP for the state has been delayed for a few years due to various reasons. The deadline has been extended frequently. Chennai-based National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM) had submitted the draft CZMP to the Goa government on May 9, 2017.

Last year, representatives of the NCSCM had made constituency-wise presentations of the draft CZMP to MLAs and ministers, who had strongly raised objections to the draft plan.",2019-03-23T03:11:00Z
The Times of India,Central University of Punjab coordinating and monitoring MOEFCC supported project on invasive alien plants in 12 Himalayan states of the country - Times of India,Seema Sharma,"CHANDIGARH: Invasive Alien Species (pose a major threat to the ecology and economy in invaded regions especially forest and hill ecosystems. They cause a major change in vegetation at global level and threaten biodiversity. The problem of invasion has gained momentum in last two decades because of global economic growth.

Realising the seriousness of the issue, the ministry of environment and forests and climate change (MOEFCC) has initiated a three year coordinated research program on ""Invasive Alien plants in Himalayan States: Status, Ecological Impact and Management involving all the 12 hill states of Indian Himalayas. Seven organisations and 11 investigators who are highly experienced in the field of invasion ecology are involved in this research program. The entire research project is being coordinated and monitored by Central University of Punjab at Bathinda.

There are six implementing agencies involved in the cumulative research namely, University of Kashmir, Punjab University, Botanical Survey of India, National Botanical Research Institute, North Eastern Hill University and North Eastern Regional Institute of Science and Technology at Niruli, Arunachal Pardesh are implementing agencies.

Long ago in 2009, the ministry also sponsored a two-day brainstorming meeting on the issue of Invasive alien plants in India , concerns and solution"". Convention on Biological Diversity had also set the target of reducing the rate of loss of biodiversity by 2010. It was followed by The International Union of Forest Research Organisation sponsored international meet on Risk Analysis of forest Invasive Alien Species in 2013.

Dr RK Kohli, vice-chancellor, Central University of Punjab who has been instrumental in starting department of environment in Punjab University also told TOI, ""India is a mega-diversity country with three biodiversity hotspots out of 34 in Unesco's Man and Biosphere list and 10 bio-geographic regions. It has become a favoured place of invasion by alien species. The fast increasing economic growth coupled with tourism and trade is expected to result into more trans boundary influx of exotic species into India and thus homogenisation of flora and fauna. India lacks data on the total area occupied by alien plants and even on total number of such species in Himalayan states. This project is aiming to fulfil these gaps. ""

He said that researchers would prepare new database with complete inventory and chalk out distribution areas infested by invasive alien species in the Indian Himalayas. They would also come up with a dynamic model about rate and mode of spread including vectors responsible with GPS and ground trothing. Base line studies and assessment reports would also be submitted to the state agencies regarding disappearance of native plant species. . Policy and legislative mechanism for management and eradication/ mitigation would be framed with effective control measures. The local communities would be informed about value addition and sustainable utilization of bio-resources for their livelihood.

There are two faculty members of Punjab University as researchers who are engaged with this project in Himalayan region of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. They are Professor Daizy Batish (Botany) and Harminder Pal Singh (Environment).

Batish said that so far she has identified Paranthesis, Lantana, Agertina, Agertun, Bidend , Targetes Minuta, paper mulberry species most commonly in these two states. ""Local people in the Himlayan region are facing problems due to these alien plants causing toxicity and allergies to people and cattle, "" she said adding that the these plants have begun evolving, changing their reproduction strategy as well. ""You will see Paranthesis in plains with more green leaves and less flowering but in higher region , they have lesser leaves and lot of flowers which shows that this plant is now aiming to multiply and spread in higher up regions as well.""",2019-02-06T12:46:00Z
The Times of India,"No Centre nod yet, Bandhwari waste plant to miss August deadline - Times of India",Shubhra Pant,"GURUGRAM: The proposed waste-to-energy plant (WTP) at Bandhwari is likely to miss its first deadline of August 2019, as the approval from the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF&CC) is still pending. According to sources within MCG, given the current status of things, the plant is unlikely to be functional before end-2019.

MCG had first submitted an application for permission with MoEF&CC in October 2016, but it was not approved due to some additional requirements and amendments.

""We submitted the amended application in October 2018, but the approval from the ministry is yet to arrive. Once approved, work will start immediately,"" said Ravinder Yadav, joint commissioner, MCG. When asked about any new deadline for the project to become operational, Yadav said work is under progress but everything depends on the permit. ""The plant should be functional by end-2019,"" said the commissioner.

Officials at the appointed agency, Ecogreen Energy Private Limited, also admitted everything hinges upon the ministry's permit. ""We're keen to finish the project at the earliest, but we're still waiting for the permission. There is a meeting at the ministry scheduled for next month in this regard,"" said Gaurav Joshi, COO, Ecogreen.

Meanwhile, the landfill at the Bandhwari site is not getting any smaller, what with even the composting unit of the plant yet to become functional.

The foundation stone for the plant was laid by the chief minister in the second week of April 2018, amid strong criticism from environmental activists who pointed to the fact that the agency did not have the MoEF&CC's clearance. At that time, Ecogreen had clarified that they do not need approval for laying the foundation stone.

The Bandhwari WTP will be India's biggest such plant with a projected power generation capacity of 25MW, more than the similar plant in Bawana, Delhi, which has a capacity of 24MW. It is being developed as part of the integrated waste management plan at Bandhwari, along Gurugram-Faridabad road. The WTP will have a capacity of processing up to 2,500 tonnes of waste per day.

Currently, Gurugram generates around 850-900 tonnes of solid waste every day, while another 600 tonnes is generated by Faridabad.",2019-01-27T02:17:00Z
The Hindu,Adopt responsible mining model: KSSP,,"The Kerala Sastra Sahitya Parishad (KSSP) has urged the government to adopt responsible mining practices at Alappad to minimise the environmental impact of mineral sand extraction.

A press note quoting KSSP president T. Gangadharan and general secretary T.K. Meerabhai on Wednesday said the sand mining activities at Alappad had accelerated the accretion of land due to sea level rise and climate change factors.

""The high density of land in the coastal area and the accelerated erosion of land have led to concerns among the coastal population.""

Pointing out that the efforts of the government and public sector mining companies to alleviate these concerns had failed to yield results, they called for a monitoring committee to keep a constant tab on the environmental impact of mining.

The press note stressed the need for a long-term mining plan. It called for better coastal protection and a shift to deep mining practices to minimise the impact of sea washing.

The KSSP also urged the government to formulate a settlement plan for coastal communities in vulnerable stretches.",2019-01-16T18:22:00Z
https://www.hindustantimes.com/,689 endangered turtles smuggled from UP seized in Bengal,Tanmay Chatterjee,"West Bengal Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on Tuesday busted an interstate racket and seized 689 live and dead endangered Indian flapshelled turtles.

Acting on intelligence provided by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB), East Region, of the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change, CID arrested four men, all residents of Sultanpur, Uttar Pradesh, when they disembarked from Doon Express at Durgapur station in West Burdwan district at 9 am.

The men were smuggling the turtles in 22 jute sacks. The Indian flapshelled turtle is killed for its meat which is considered a delicacy in both Bengal and Bangladesh where these are smuggled.

This was the biggest seizure of endangered turtles in Bengal in recent months and the second seizure in January. Tuesday's raid established that smuggling of turtles from different parts of Uttar Pradesh is on the rise.

""The arrested youths, Laxman Kumar, Raju, Rajkumar and Sushil Kumar, are aged between 20 and 30 years and residents of Pakri village in Sultanpur district,"" said Agni Mitra, deputy director, WCCB (eastern region).

The youths told CID officers that they wanted to sell the turtles at Bandel in Hooghly district. They were handed over to the state forest department.

On January 4, officers from WCCB and state forest directorate seized 83 live Indian flapshelled turtles from Swarupnagar area of North 24 Parganas district.

On January 11, the Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force (STF) claimed to have unearthed a nexus of wildlife smugglers after rescuing 327 endangered turtles and arrested four people from Etawah.

The turtles were to be smuggled to Bangladesh through West Bengal, STF claimed. The turtles were trapped by local fishermen from canals and rivers in western Uttar Pradesh districts such as Etawah, Etah and Mainpuri. These were being taken to West Bengal in a luxury car when STF intercepted the gang.

On November 16, 2018, UP STF team intercepted a major consignment, comprising 1,583 turtles, that was being smuggled to West Bengal in a truck.",2019-01-16T15:23:00Z
The Times of India,Teri plans cost-benefit analysis of pollution fight - Times of India,Ritam Halder,"NEW DELHI: The Energy and Resources Institute (Teri) plans to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of the different measures required to combat pollution in the NCR.

These measures, suggested as a part of the report of a source-apportionment study, will be carried out by Teri and Automotive Research Association of India to derive sectorial contributions to air pollution in NCR in August 2018.

The source-apportionment study suggested remedial measures such as enhanced LPG penetration to reduce biomass burning, use of agriculture residue in power plants to prevent crop burning and coal usage, and the stringent pollution standards for industries, among others.

""We will be doing a cost-benefit analysis of the different measures suggested as part of the report. We have a clear roadmap on what needs to be done, but how feasible are these measures in terms of cost is a question that needs to be answered,"" Sumit Sharma, associate director, Earth Science and Climate Change Division, Teri, told TOI.

According to Sharma, along with the short-term measures that are already in place, there needs to be a push towards long-terms measures. ""The Graded Response Action Plan is in place since 2017. The plan was prepared on the directive of the Supreme Court after high pollution levels were recorded in the NCR in 2016. So every time the air gets fouler, measures are undertaken. Now, long-term plans also need to be looked at,"" he said.

For example, the study pointed out that fugitive dust emissions from road, construction and demolition (C&D) activities have contributed to around 5%-15% in PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations in 2016. ""In 2030, the share of this sector will increase to 8-21% for the two pollutants. Emission reduction potential of controls, such as vacuum cleaning of roads, wall-to-wall paving and use of barrier and water to control dust from construction and demolition (C&D) activities are assessed. Vacuum cleaning of road and wall-to-wall paving are assumed to have a reduction of 50% in silt content and 12% and 7% reduction in total PM10 and PM2.5 emissions of NCR, respectively,"" it says.

The study also pointed out that control of dust from construction and demolition activities, with the help of barriers and water sprinkling, may reduce the total PM10 and PM2.5 emissions in NCR by 2% and 1%, respectively.

Data for the study was derived from 10 days of air quality monitoring in nine stations in Delhi, four in UP and seven in Haryana in winter and summer of 2016-17.

According to the finding, for PM2.5 concentration during winters, the average share of transport sector in Delhi varied from 28%. Industries contributed to 30%, while biomass burning (in residences and agricultural fields) contributed to 14%. Dust (soil, road, and construction) had a share of 17%.

During summer, the share of the transport sector is about 17% in Delhi. While industries contributed 22%, biomass burning in residences and agricultural fields contributed to 15%. Dust (soil, road, and construction) had a share of 38% in summers.

Other sources contribute to 11% in winters and 8% in summer season, the study found out.",2019-01-14T03:48:00Z
The Times of India,5 new sensors to monitor air quality - Times of India,Piyush Tripathi,"PATNA: The air quality index (AQI) at Muzaffarpur was the worst in the country at 477 on Friday, followed by Patna at 452. The air quality in both cities were under ""severe"" category, which can affect healthy people and seriously impact those with existing diseases.

But, the PM2.5 (suspended particulate matter less than 2.5 microns) concentration in Patna remained the highest in the country for the third consecutive day with the maximum recorded in Kankarbagh at 717 micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m3), followed by Mithapur (535), Phulwarisharif (508) and Boring Road (444) areas.

The findings were based on the monitoring of air quality by sensors installed at different places in Patna by Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB), in association with the Centre for Environment, Energy and Climate Change (CEECC) at ADRI.

The sensors have been installed in Boring Road, IGSC planetarium, Phulwarisharif, Kankarbagh and Mithapur areas to measure PM1, PM2.5 and PM10, in addition to temperature and humidity in the air of the particular location.

BSPCB officials said the air quality assessment in Patna was being done so far only by the monitoring station at planetarium, which was not enough to give a holistic picture of the pollution level in the city.

""Since the planetarium is located in the heart of the city, the vehicular density there is also quite high, which escalates the PM2.5 figures. This further translates into higher level of AQI. In order to make a wider assessment of city air quality, we have installed five small-intensity pollution monitoring sensors at different locations and they are functioning,"" BSPCB chairman Ashok Kumar Ghosh told TOI.

The findings of the sensors oscillates between 'very poor' to 'severe' at all times in a day. However, the air pollution remains under 'very poor zone' during noon (2-5pm) at Boring Road, Phulwarisharif, Kankarbagh and Mithapur. The pollution level escalates during 5-10pm.

CEECC experts said high level of air pollution can lead up to 15% increase in household budget. ""The neighbourhood monitoring clearly depicts that traffic congestion leading to higher emission of black carbon during the peak hours, open littering of garbage, along with road dust and biomass burnings are major sources of air pollution in the city. Most of the vehicles plying in Patna are more than 15 years old. The other unique feature is the fuel used in the commercial eateries are coal and other biomass, which substantially contribute to the PM level in the city,"" said Abinash Mohanty, director-cum-ENVIS-coordinator at CEECC.",2019-01-05T01:30:00Z

The principal bench, New Delhi, also directed the ministry to revise the procedure related to this notification, as allowing DEIAA to issue the EC was contrary to a related Supreme Court order.

The bench stated that the ministry should file a compliance report after the revision of procedure by December 31, 2018. If it fails to do so, coercive measures may have to be taken.

In Goa, the state environment impact assessment authority (SEIAA) has granted ECs for sand mining in the past. But in a few cases, DEIAA has issued ECs for quarrying activities, a source said.

The tribunal had in an order dated September 13, 2018, directed revision of the procedure. The apex court in a separate order had also laid down that proper environmental clearance was needed before grant of lease of minor minerals, including sand mining.

However, the ministry in a notification dated January 15, 2016, had permitted DEIAA to issue the EC. While passing an order in September related to a complaint that the ministry had not withdrawn the power given to DEIAA, the tribunal noted that the district expert appraisal committee (DEAC) comprises officers with no expertise or scientific knowledge to assess environment implications.

The project is very crucial for the city's drinking water supply and the district's irrigation because of less water stored in Totladoh and Navegaon (Kamptee) khairi reservoirs.

The WRD had been pursuing for 72 hectare forest land since 2008-09 but got the clearance of the ministry of environment, forests and climate change on May 16 this year.

As of now, the state water resources department (WRD) has spent Rs507 crore out of Rs947 crore, the total cost of the project. Now the only hurdle in the project is the release of the remaining amount of Rs244 crore as the state government has allocated only Rs1 crore in current financial year. The project has to be partially completed before next monsoon -- June 2019 -- and completed by December next year.

City MP and Union minister for water resources Nitin Gadkari has convened a meeting on Tuesday in Mumbai with chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to discuss about the availability of remaining Rs244 crore in the current fiscal itself. Guardian minister Chandrashekar Bawankule will also be present at the meeting.

The state's revenue and forest department issued a notification on October 8 transferring 51 hectare zudpi jungle and protected forest for the project. The land is situated in eight villages -- Kochi, Pilala (Rithi), Badegaon, Kharduka, Tembhurdoh, Chorkhairi, Raiwadi and Dhalgaon (khairi) in Saoner tehsil.

WRD executive engineer P N Patil told TOI the MP government too transferred 21 hectare of forest land for the project few days ago. ""Now we have the possession of entire required land of 1,485 hectare for the project. Earlier, we acquired private and government-owned lands,"" he said.

Completed 65% as of now, the project will have storage capacity of 75 million meter cube (MMC) of which 57 MMC will be utilized for irrigating 4,500 hectare of agriculture land and remaining for drinking water supply to few villages, towns and Koradi thermal power project.

Coming up on Kanhan river, the project will not have any impact on availability of raw drinking water for the city.

WRD superintending engineer L P Ingale said 1,200 MMC water is available in Kanhan river. ""The Kochi project will get only 75 MMC. Thus, NMC can continue to utilize its total reservation from the river,"" he said.

The NMC can also get more water from Navegaon Khairi reservoir once 4,500 hectare agriculture land gets water from the Kochi project.

The Times of India,Bandhwari water to be tested for toxins - Times of India,Shilpy Arora,"GURUGRAM: The state pollution control board (HSPCB) on Thursday collected groundwater samples from Bandhwari to check the level of groundwater contamination. This was the fourth time samples of groundwater have been collected in the last three years.

Sources said the samples were collected from four borewells -- one located opposite the Bandhwari waste treatment plant, another located close to Gurugram-Faridabad border, and two in Bandhwari village. Environmentalists said the step was prompted by instructions given by the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF&CC), but board officials claimed it was a routine exercise.

""I'm happy the board sprung into action after the Union ministry sent instructions. However, I'm not very hopeful of any action that will be taken by the state environment department, as they have a history of bias,"" alleged activist Vaishali Rana Chandra, who lives in Gurugram-Faridabad road.

She met officials in the Union ministry in April to express her concerns over groundwater contamination in Bandhwari.

Jai Bhagwan, regional officer, HSPCB (north), told TOI, ""It was a routine procedure. This time, we took along NGOs and activists. We're not aware of any letter sent by the Union ministry.""

The letter, whose copy is with TOI, was sent to the state principal secretary for environment, on May 20. In 2016, HSPCB had twice collected groundwater samples, after green activists alleged that the cesspool of leachate that had formed behind the plant was seeping into the groundwater. The board confirmed it had found evidence of groundwater contamination after the first test, but said it had found no groundwater contamination the second time samples were collected and tested.

However, in 2017, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) found many contaminates and deterioration of ground water quality, calling the groundwater 'unfit for drinking' in a report submitted to the green tribunal.

The municipal corporations of Gurugram and Faridabad set up the waste treatment plant at Bandhwari in 2009-10. But a fire at the plant in 2013 kept it inoperative for the next four years. In 2017, MCG appointed a private firm to set up a waste-to-energy plant at the site, the foundation stone for which was laid by Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar this April, although approval from MoEF&CC is still pending. The plant is expected to become operational in 2019.

The Times of India,"Allow use of Metro excavated material, MbPT asks Centre - Times of India",Clara Lewis,"MUMBAI: The Mumbai Port Trust (MbPT) is keen to use the excavated rock material generated from the Mumbai Metro rail project to construct an oil berth at Jawahar Deep.

Terming it good rock material, MbPT, in an application to the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change has sought an amendment to the environmental clearance granted for the oil berth project to allow use of excavated rock instead of dredged rock.

MbPT said by the time the approval came in March for use of dredged rock, the contractor had disposed most of the over 17 lakh cubic metre. MbPT said the rock being excavated at Metro stations is good material. ""There is no dumping place for this rock material in the vicinity. It has to be sent to locations more than 50km away through trucks. It would be environmental friendly if the same material is transported through sea by barges and used for reclamation of the balance area at Jawahar Dweep,"" said MbPT.

R Ramana, MMRC executive director, said the project would generate 10 million cubic metres of muck in three years. ""We have identified quarries for dumping as we may not generate at the pace required by other agencies.

If any agency needs it for purposes that are environmentally better, the contractor will be willing to give the same."" The ministry's expert appraisal committee has deferred its decision on allowing the Metro excavated material to be used for reclamation and has asked for a study on the impact of the disposal on marine ecology and biodiversity. Also, a study of its impact on traffic has been sought.",2018-07-19T03:35:00Z
The Times of India,Army's Eco Task Force to fight deforestation in Assam's Sonitpur with seed balls - Times of India,Naresh Mitra,"GUWAHATI: The 134 Eco-Task Force (ETF) of the Territorial Army has planned to launch full-scale a war against deforestation by using ""seed balls"" technology in Sonitpur, the district on the northern banks of Brahmaputra that has since large-scale felling of trees since the 1990s.

Col S Aravind Prasad, who heads 134 ETF based at the fringe of Nameri National Park in Sonitpur, said that his unit is working on introducing ""seed balls"" technology to intensify afforestation drive to mitigate the impacts of climate change.

In this technology, seeds are rolled into a ball of earth, humus and other nutrients and can keep the seed alive for several months.

""You just throw or drop seed balls, and in due course of time, the seed will germinate into plants. This process of dispersing seed balls is called broadcast. It has the advantage over conventional way of sapling plantation by consuming less time and covering more areas by a green cover,"" Col Prasad said.

He said that his unit is in the process of procuring one million seed balls of forest variety native species.

Over 32,000 saplings planted by ETF involving the local villagers, school and college students, NCC cadets, forest department and Army in Sonitpur and Biswanath districts during the week-long Van Mahotsav recently.

Col Prasad that the process of participatory plantation drive will continue so that more people get involved in fighting deforestation.

""We are also working on a participatory model for the afforestation drive so that people become an intrinsic part of the plantation drive,"" he added.

Experts estimated that almost 70% of 1334-odd square kilometre of forest area in the district has been encroached and destroyed. In the 1990s, Sonitpur witnessed large-scale deforestation and encroaching, wiping out many of the reserved forests of green cover as for instance the 81 sq km Naduar was bereft of tree cover. Many attributed to the insurgency problem during the 1990s led to deforestation.",2018-07-08T17:32:00Z
The Times of India,Green nod not required for national park tunnel: Centre - Times of India,Clara Lewis,"MUMBAI: No environmental clearance (EC) is required for the proposed Goregaon-Mulund Link Road (GMLR) that will pass through a hill while traversing through the Sanjay Gandhi National Park. This has been conveyed to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) by the impact assessment division of the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC).

The BMC will, however, require forest clearance and also clearances from the state and national wildlife boards. A civic official said that since no forest diversion is required, the forest clearance will be granted at the state level.

The BMC has submitted the proposal to the Park officials. It is expected to be forwarded to Mantralaya soon, where it will be placed before the State Wildlife Board. A senior official from the revenue and forest department said since no forest diversion is required for the road, the civic body will not be asked to carry out any compensatory afforestation. Also, only 50% of the 'net present value' of the forest will be required to be paid by the BMC.

While the BMC has carried out a biodiversity study for three months, it has now discontinued the study since the EC is no longer required. ""If the state forest department insists on it, we will carry out further studies. The three-month study was submitted to the MoEFCC,"" said a civic official.

The MoEFCC, in its letter to the chief engineer in charge of GMLR, said the BMC did not provide correct information when it submitted the proposal online for environment clearance for the project and sought terms of reference. Then, in March 2018, the BMC sought permission to withdraw the proposal as the link road does not directly connect the Eastern and Western Express highways, instead it joins on either side a local Development Plan road. Also, the link road does not form part of any state or national highway and so does not attract provisions of the Environment Impact Notification, 2006.

The BMC again submitted a clarification to Mo-EFCC in May through the state public works department. ""In the light of information provided, the project does not attract provisions of EIA notification 2006,"" states the MoEFCC letter.

Senior civic officials said the civic standing committee on Wednesday cleared widening of the AK Vaidya Marg at Goregaon (E) and the road linking the LBS Marg to the Eastern Express highway. Both form part of the 13.7km GMLR. The widening is to be done at an estimated cost of Rs120 crore.

The total project cost is estimated at Rs4,000 crore. The 4.7km stretch that passes under the hill through SGNP is estimated to cost Rs3,000 crore. The entire project is estimated to be completed in four years and will cut down travel time to 15 minutes. Anish Andheria, president, Wildlife Conservation Society and member of the State Wildlife Board said the forest clearance is equally stringent. ""We will ensure all conditions are complied with and neither wildlife nor the forest is short-changed,"" he said.

Naturalist Shardul Bijaikar said that the so-called development authorities have a penchant for finding escape routes for circumventing wildlife laws. ""SGNP is unique in the world in more than one way. What authorities fail to see is the huge loss of biodiversity and ecosystem if proper, rigorous assessments and studies are not carried out. The ill-effects of such projects will often be irreversible,"" he said.

GMLR's section through the SGNP, though called an underground tunnel, is to be a tunnel through a hill in the national park.",2018-07-06T03:36:00Z
The Times of India,Cong MLA of Buldhana too opposes rly line through Melghat - Times of India,Vijay Pinjarkar,"Nagpur: Even as South Central Railway (SCR) is insisting on upgrading the meter gauge railway line through Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR), the move has created a political storm, with the Congress being the latest to jump on to the bandwagon opposing the decision.

On June 26, Congress MLA from Buldhana Harshawardhan Sapkal urged governor C Vidyasagar Rao to stop the anti-environment move to broaden the 176km Akola-Khandwa railway line, of which 39km passes through the tiger reserve.

Earlier, BJP MLA from Jalgaon-Jamod Dr Sanjay Kute had, on June 6, written to chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to oppose the project through MTR.

Sapkal told TOI, MTR is home to 50 tigers and the Centre has taken the decision without considering climate change issues. ""Melghat has come up slowly in the last 46 years by spending crores of rupees on conservation. It is the country's fourth biggest reserve with an area of 2,768 sq km and acts as lungs of Vidarbha, and broad gauge line destroying rich biodiversity is not acceptable,"" he said.

""Instead of going through MTR, I would suggest connecting the line via Akola-Jalamb-Akot. A broad gauge line already exists between Akola-Jalamb,"" Sapkal said.

The Congress MLA said as per Human Development Index (HDI), Jalgaon-Jamod and Sangrampur blocks outside MTR are backward, and railway infrastructure would bring social and economic development as a population of over 2.50 lakh people can benefit.

On Thursday, Youth Congress activists from Jalgaon-Jamod submitted a memorandum to the SDO against taking up the project through MTR. They demanded alternative route through Hiwarkhed-Sonala-Jalgaon Jamod.

However, even as villagers are gearing up against the upgradation of railway line, SCR is reluctant to budge. SCR chief public relations officer (CPRO) Umashankar M did not respond to TOI calls on Thursday. On Monday, he had promised to come back with details.

After a meeting between highways minister Nitin Gadkari and railway minister Piyush Goyal on June 18 at Delhi, SC Jain, executive director (works), Railway Board, had on June 19 issued a letter asking SCR to start work on the project as clearances are not needed.

When SCR's chief engineer (construction) GRK Reddy was asked about the ownership of the land through MTR, he said, ""When meter gauge is passing through the reserve, no doubt the land belongs to the railways. We will go ahead with the upgradation as planned, but it will take some time.""

However, when the NTCA team constituted by the government to examine the feasibility visited the site, there was no record to state whether the said land with claimed right of way (ROW) belonged to the railways. This fact has also been mentioned in the NTCA report.

TOI has already reported NTCA concluded that the project through tiger reserve is unfeasible. On Wednesday, taking note of the issue, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court has admitted a series of TOI reports as PIL filed by social worker Pramod Junghare.

Wildlife lawyer Manish Jeswani says the railways will have to prove ownership of land. ""Even if ROW belongs to them, they cannot circumvent forest clearance,"" he said.",2018-06-29T14:13:00Z

The Hindu,Want to settle all issues in a friendly ambience: Hasina,"Shiv Sahay Singh, Suvojit Bagchi","Says India should put pressure on Myanmar govt. to resettle Rohingya refugees

Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Friday said that there are various pending issues between India and Bangladesh, and that they wanted to settle all of them in a friendly ambience.

Ms. Hasina and Prime Minister Narendra Modi participated in two back-to-back events at Visva Bharati University in Santiniketan -- the convocation of the university and the inauguration of the Bangladesh Bhavana -- and laid emphasis on the shared cultural heritage.

""We have sorted out many bilateral issues. There are still some pending ones but I don't want to spoil the beautiful occasion by referring to them. We want to settle all issues in a friendly ambience,"" Ms. Hasina said at the inauguration of Bangladesh Bhavana, a cultural complex with a museum narrating the history of the 1971 Liberation War, on the campus of Visva Bharati.

Her comment was an obvious reference to the Teesta dispute.

Ms. Hasina also urged for ""cooperation from all to put pressure"" on the government of Myanmar so that over one million Rohingya, who had taken shelter in Bangladesh, could return to their country. ""We want them [the Rohingya] to return to their country. We want the region to remain peaceful,"" she said.

The Prime Minister of Bangladesh gave an emotional speech on how India stood by Bangladesh during its liberation war of 1971 and then in 1975 when her father Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rehman and other members of her family were assassinated.

Reflecting on the land boundary agreement which settled the enclave issue, she said it was a rare example of border issues between two countries having been sorted out ""amicably.""

Mr. Modi said the relations between the two countries were born out of ""shared struggles of the past"" and both were facing common problems like climate change. ""The kind of friendship between India and Bangladesh, contributing to each other's development, is an example which the other countries can follow and learn from,"" he said. Underlining the importance of ""mutual cooperation,"" he said both countries ""can learn from each other in areas of public policy and culture.""

""The progress made by Bangladesh in the area of social sector, particularly in improving the lives of people, is something we can take inspiration from,"" he said. Mr. Modi spoke of increased cooperation in areas like connectivity, space connectivity and power. None of the leaders said anything on the sharing of river water.

Minister of Cultural Affairs of Bangladesh Asaduzzaman Noor told The Hindu on Friday that they are optimistic about discussions on Teesta.

In her brief speech West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee quoted extensively from Rabindranath and Kazi Nazrul Islam to say that the relationship with Bangladesh will ""deepen"" despite differences.

""Lot of water has flowed [regarding relationship] between the two countries and a lot will flow, but the relationship between the two countries will flourish,"" she said.

Ms. Banerjee will meet Prime Minister Hasina in her central Kolkata hotel on Saturday evening. Ms. Hasina is also expected to brief the press.

Shared heritage

Both the leaders spoke about the contribution of Rabindranth Tagore and how the poet is a shared cultural icon between the two countries.

""He is as important to India as he is to Bangladesh,"" Mr. Modi said, adding that Tagore is a ""shared heritage between the two countries which could not be divided by the British or even partition of the country.""

The Prime Minister described the Nobel laureate as the first global citizen whose influence knew no borders.

Just as the Government of Bangladesh has constructed Bangladesh Bhawan at Visva Bharati, Mr. Modi said the Government of India has taken up the task of renovating Kuthi Bari in Kustia district of Bangladesh.

Both Mr. Modi and Ms. Hasina made repeated references to the fact that the national anthem of both the countries is by Tagore.

Ms. Hasina said most of the poems written by Tagore were during his stay in Bangladesh and thus their claim on the poet can be no less than India's.

While recounting how fond her father was of the poems by Gurudev, Ms. Hasina announced setting up of two new universities named after Rabindranath Tagore, one at Shahajpur and the other at Kustia, both the places where the Tagore family managed large zamindari estates.",2018-05-25T19:16:00Z

The AAI wants to hike its capacity from 6.8 million to 11.2 million by 2021 by extending the existing integrated terminal building and apron. The current integrated terminal building, which handles both domestic and international passengers, is near saturated.

An expert appraisal committee (EAC) of the MoEFCC has issued the terms of reference to conduct the environmental impact assessment (EIA) study for the proposed expansion. After the EIA study is completed, the panel has recommended public consultation, and that the comments of the public hearing be incorporated in the EIA study.

The present proposal is to extend the existing building towards the east by demolishing the old terminal building, internally modifying the existing terminal building, and extending the existing apron to the east.

As per the terms of reference, the EIA will have to submit a justification for land requirement along with a comparison to guidelines established by the AAI and ministry of civil aviation. It also is expected to submit a complete status and compliance report with regards to any earlier EC granted and permissions and consents from the the respective pollution boards for existing facilities.",2018-05-06T02:58:00Z
The Times of India,Centuries-old rosewood trees in Wayanad face the axe - Times of India,,"KOZHIKODE: In a government- sponsored plunder of precious tree wealth in Wayanad, over 1,000 rosewood (popularly known as Eeti) trees, many of which are centuries old, are being felled from the land parcels which were assigned by the government to ex-servicemen .

The land parcels were assigned to the soldiers, who had participated in the WW-II, by the British under the 'Wayanad colonisation scheme'. However, the valuable rosewood (dalbergia latifolia) trees, along with teak, are the property of the government as they were reserved and vested to the state government when the title deeds were formally granted to the landholders in 1969.

Now, the forest department has given contracts to two contractors to cut 1,077 rosewood trees in various plots spread over Thomattuchal revenue village under Meppadi range in South Wayanad forest division and to transport it to the timber depot of the forest department at Chaliyam in Kozhikode and at Kuppadi in Wayanad, from where it would be auctioned off.

Greens say that many of the trees could be around 500 years old and the decision to cut them down reeked of gross environmental insensitivity from the part of forest department, especially when the district was facing the adverse effect of environmental degradation and climate change.

""It is ironical that the mass felling of rosewood trees comes at a time when the government is moving ahead with plans to make Wayanad the first carbon- neutral district in the country and has even announced incentives for the public for planting trees. The government should have taken into account their heritage value or at least the ecosystem services the ancient trees provide as they are host to a range of species from rare orchids to birds, moss and lichen,"" N Badusha, president of the Wayanad Prakrithi Samrakshana Samithi said.

He added that most of the trees are healthy and could still survive for decades if left untouched. Some of the trees which are being felled are huge with girth measuring around 18 feet and they could well be over 500 years old, he added.

The contractors have already started felling the trees in Ambalavayal and Moopainad panchayats. The owners of the land are being paid Rs 10,000 per cubic metre of wood as compensation. In a similar drive, the teak trees in assigned land parcels were felled in 1995.

Rosewood tree has been classified as a vulnerable species as per IUCN Red List in 1998 as the wild subpopulations are widely overexploited due to its high commercial value. Also, low germination rate of seeds in natural condition and slow growth rate of the species has led to dwindling population even in the forest areas of the state.

Also, there is acute shortage of rosewood in global market due to strict export controls in place in several countries. Indian rosewood, especially from the Western Ghats, is one of the priciest timber species and is known for its unique colours varying from rose to dark-brown.

Meanwhile, forest officials said that the decision to cut the trees was taken as they have become mature and following petitions from landholders that the mature trees were posing threat to their property.

""Also, under the Wayanad colonisation scheme, it is the responsibility of the government to fell and remove the mature trees,""south Wayanad divisional forest officer P Renjith Kumar said.

The forest department is set to net crores of rupees through the auction as a cubic metre of rosewood could fetch between Rs 2 lakh and Rs 5 lakh.",2018-04-17T05:33:00Z
The Times of India,GE Power bags Rs 309 crore FGD order from NTPC - Times of India,,"New Delhi, Mar 20 () GE Power India today said it has been awarded a contract worth Rs 309 crore by NTPC to install its FGD system at Phase-I (2X800 MW) of its Super Thermal Power Project (STPP) in Telangana.New Delhi, Mar 20 () GE Power India today said it has been awarded a contract worth Rs 309 crore by NTPC to install its FGD system at Phase-I (2X800 MW) of its Super Thermal Power Project (STPP) in Telangana.

This is the first standalone Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) order for GE in the country since the notification of new emission norms for thermal power plants by the Ministry of Environment, Forests & Climate Change (MoEF & CC) in December 2015, a GE Power statement said.

The Wet FGD system will have a wet limestone-based open spray tower type design, comprising of an absorber system, slurry preparation and dewatering system. The FGD package will be installed in a period of 30 months for Unit-1 and 36 months for Unit-2 from the date of contract, it added.

""Technologies such as FGD can play a significant role in controlling emissions from coal-based plants by reducing the SOx content in exit flue gas to the lowest levels anywhere in the world,"" said Andrew H DeLeone, MD, GE Power India in a statement.

Following the emission norms for SOx (sulphur oxides) control issued by environment ministry in December 2015, it is mandatory for all thermal power plants in India to install FGD technology. An installed base of around 165 GW of thermal plant has been identified by CEA for implementation of FGD, over and above the power plants presently under execution, it added.

With this new award, the GE will further strengthen its position in the FGD market. This builds on GE's previous standalone FGD project in India for NTPC's Phase V, Unit- XIII (1 X 500 MW) Vindyachal Thermal Power Plant. In addition, the GE is also executing Turbine Island package for Telangana Phase-I (2X800 MW) STPP, it said.",2018-03-20T12:51:00Z
The Times of India,Gram sabha definition in draft CAF rules could deprive some forest dwellers of consultation: MoTA - Times of India,Jayashree Nandi,"NEW DELHI: The ministry of tribal affairs (MoTA) has raised a number of concerns with the draft rules for implementation of the compensatory afforestation fund (CAF) Act, notified by the union environment ministry recently. A major concern according to MoTA officials is they way gram sabha has been defined in draft rules.

Senior officials at the tribal affairs ministry said the ministry was not consulted during the framing of the rules despite tribals being the most important stakeholder in plantation and conservation projects of the government in forest areas. Environment ministry officials however claimed that the tribal affairs ministry was consulted earlier.

The draft rules define gram sabha ""as the same meaning as assigned to it in article 243(B) of the Constitution."" which states ""gram sabha means a body consisting of persons registered in the electoral rolls relating to a village comprised within the area of panchayat at the village level."" ""The role of gram sabha has been broadened strengthened after the forest rights act 2006 came in to force. But the environment ministry has completely overlooked the FRA definition of gram sabha,"" a senior official of the Tribal Affairs ministry told TOI.

The ministry has also called for a consultation of civil society and tribal organisations on the draft rules on March 18. FRA 2006 defines gram sabha as ""a village assembly which shall consist of all adult members of a village and in case of states having no panchayats, padas, tolas and other traditional village institutions and elected village committees, with full and unrestricted participation of women."" By not specifying, the new definition consultations with forest dwellers could be restricted to panchayat level villages, officials said. The draft rules also state that when afforestation or plantation projects are to be taken up in forest land under the control of forest department and being managed under a working plan with participation of local people, then they should be taken up in consultation with gram sabha or the Van Sanrakshan Samiti or the village forest committee as the case may be. Tribal affairs ministry officials said the gram sabha's consent cannot be interchangeable with other non-statutory bodies.

The ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC) came out with draft rules for the utilisation of Rs 50,000 crore compensatory afforestation fund on February 16 but a copy of the draft was leaked months back before it was notified.

""Artificial regeneration provision or plantations is also an issue because it may impact of the gene pool in our forests. We also need to know how tribals will be consulted, whether their opinion will be taken on board in areas where plantation activities will be taken up under the CAF Act. They should have tested the waters with us before notifying the draft rules,"" the official added.

Tribal Affairs ministry officials who will be sending their comments to the environment ministry soon also pointed that in the draft rules, the tribal affairs ministry officials are not explicitly made members in any committee. For example in the selection committee for the appointment of non-official members to the national authority for utilisation of CAF Act, apart from environment ministry officials, it states ""one secretary from any other ministry to be nominated by the MoEFCC."" ""They should have been explicit about which ministry,"" said MoTA officials. Following various objections to the CAF act raised by some Congress leaders in 2016, late environment minister, Anil Madhav Dave had assured the Rajya Sabha that rules would provide for necessary consultation with gram sabhas.

A senior environment ministry official from forest policy division told TOI, ""Who is to define gram sabha? It was in existence even before the FRA was enacted. Every act cannot have a separate definition of gram sabha. MoTA should go back and look at their two year old records on whether their officials were consulted. The environment ministry cannot overlook the tribal affairs ministry. Their views may not be incorporated but will be taken care of to the extent possible.""

What is compensatory afforestation?

Every time forest land is diverted for non-forest purposes like mining or industry, the user agency is supposed to ""afforest"" an area of the same size of the forests that were diverted. Since these plantations do not immediately provide the ecological services that the natural forest that was cut down would provide, the law requires the user agency to compensate the loss by paying the ""net present value (NPV)"" of the forests for the next 50 years. The NPV, calculated by a panel of experts is anywhere between Rs 5 and Rs 11 lakh depending on the type and quality of forests that were diverted.

How will the CAF fund be utilised?

80% of the net present value (NPV) of forests can be utilised for:

* Assisted natural regeneration

* Artificial regeneration (by plantation)

* Silvicultural operations in forests

* Protection of plantations and forests

* Pest and disease control in forest

* Forest fire prevention

* Soil and moisture conservation

* Planting and rejuvenation of forest cover on non-forest land falling in wildlife corridors

* Relocation of villages from protected areas

Rest of the 20% can be utilized for ""strengthening of forest and wildlife related infrastructure, capacity building of state forest department personnel"" among others.",2018-02-26T06:35:00Z

NPNS trustee Jayesh Patel told TNN, ""We together with Bharuch Citizen Council and other groups are in advance stage of filing a petition in the NGT. We will request for the issuance of a directive from NGT in the context of its recent order on river Ganga that minimum environmental flow of 20 per cent needs to be maintained for continuity of aquatic ecosystem. All states were directed to maintain a minimum environmental flow of 15 to 20 per cent of the average lean season course in their rivers. The same is applicable to river Narmada's flow too.""

Bharuch Citizen Council president Jivraj Patel said, ""We can't close our eyes the way downstream is being treated. The decision of releasing water at the rate of 600 cusecs downstream was wrong as none had visualized its long-term impact on the river's ecosystem. Technocrats should know that once seawater ingress reaches up to 60km inside the river basin, it will be impossible to check salinity.""

A Gandhian Badri Joshi said, ""Over 75 per cent of Gujarat now is dependent on water supplied through canals for drinking, irrigation and industrial use. This will lead to a major disaster in future because we don't have any alternative source. If things are not set right now, water riots cannot be ruled out in future in the state.""",2018-02-10T22:59:00Z
The Times of India,21 mining leases may get nod in today's meet - Times of India,Murari Shetye,"Panaji: Goa state pollution control board (GSPCB) will hold a crucial meeting of its members on Monday to decide whether consent to operate be granted to 21 mining leases, most of which have obtained environment clearance certificates.

At least 17 companies had been granted environmental clearances (EC) by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) as per its 1994 notification on environment impact assessment (EIA).

During its last meeting, convened to grant consent to operate to 12 mining leases, board members had expressed opinion that another meeting be held to consider the pending applications.

The board had recently granted consent to five mining leases which had environmental clearances as required under the 1994 notification.

The Supreme Court in Odisha mining case had observed that environment clearance issued under 1994 EIA notification is valid only for five years.

Based on this judgment, pollution board had started the process not to renew the mining leases which had EC under 1994 notification. It had also issued show cause notices to those companies which had such clearances.

Prior to the last meeting, board had taken legal opinion which advised it to grant consent to operate to leases which had environment clearance, but subject to court orders.

Recently, the ministry had asked the board to conduct a fresh hearing for those leaseholders which had clearances under 1994 notification before granting fresh approval.

The development comes days after the agency grilled Lalu Prasad's wife and former Bihar chief minister Rabri Devi for over six hours.

Agency sources claimed that the land near Saguna Mor was registered under the name of Delight Marketing Pvt Ltd in 2005 at the book value of Rs 1.9 crore but is presently valued at Rs 44.60 crore.

Delight marketing was rechristened as Lara Projects LLP in 2016, in which Rabri and her younger son and leader of opposition in Bihar legislative assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav are the only two shareholders.

It is alleged that Delight Marketing as well as its successor Lara Projects are shell firms run by Lalu's family.

A mall with provisions for a five-star hotel, multiplex, shopping complex, office tower and as many as 1,000 shops was being developed on the land by Meridian Construction (India) Limited, a firm owned by RJD MLA and Lalu's close associate Abu Dojana.

However, a stay on construction of the mall was imposed by the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change in May for not taking a mandatory environmental clearance for the same.

On September 12, the income tax (I-T) department issued an attachment order of over a dozen properties under the railways tender case in Patna and Delhi including the land of the mall at Saguna Mor, a farm house and a land in Palam Vihar area in south Delhi's upmarket New Friends Colony area.

Meanwhile, the Enforcement Case Information Report (ECIR) lodged by ED on July 27 is broadly based on the FIR lodged by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on July 5 in the railways tender case against Lalu, Rabri, their younger son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav and others.

The FIR states that Lalu allegedly extended favors to Sujata Hotels, a company owned by Vijay and Vinay Kochhar, in awarding a contract for the upkeep of Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) hotels in Ranchi and Puri and received premium land near Saguna Mor in Patna under a ""quid pro quo"" deal.

Tejashwi earlier appeared before ED investigators in New Delhi on October 10 and November 13 for marathon quizzing.

Calling the move a political vendetta, Tejashwi said that the ED was working under pressure from the central government.

""I have appeared before ED twice, my mother (Rabri) has also appeared before them once and answered all their questions. Still they have issued the attachment order. Though we know that it is a routine affair but ED is surely working under pressure from the central government. BJP is misusing central government agencies against opposition leaders including us,"" he said.

Tejashwi added that he is waiting for the CBI to file its chargesheet in the railways tender case, following which he would give point-wise explanation on the charges levelled against his family in the court as well as in public domain.",2017-12-08T11:36:00Z
The Times of India,"Project Tiger to Project Cow? Yes, if VHP has its way - Times of India",,"NEW DELHI: The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) yesterday said the cow should be made India's national animal. Not because its numbers are in decline, but because it is revered by millions.

If that happens, the cow will replace the Bengal Tiger, which was made the national animal to enable a focus on its conservation, after its numbers saw a steep decline in the 1960s and early 1970s.

Now, if the cow replaces the tiger as national animal it might put paid to the 45 years of conservation efforts that have seen the tiger population rise to 2,226 from a mere 1,827 in 1972. And if making the cow the national animal leads to an increase in its population - like it did for the tiger - it may well undermine India's climate change goals.

Why?

Project Tiger vs Project Cow

More tigers: Good for the ecology and by extension, for habitats. As a former head of Project Tiger told PTI earlier this year, ""The tiger is an umbrella species under whose shadow millions of other organisms are being saved.""

More cows: More bovine flatulence, ergo a rise in methane emissions. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas. And India already has the world's largest population of ruminant - cud-chewing animals like buffalos and cows - animals.

This can become a real worry, if the success of Project Tiger - the conservation effort launched in 1973 - is any indication.

A brief look at how the tiger population has improved due to its being named the national animal might help.

How tiger population rose

Interestingly, the tiger wasn't always the national animal. Until 1972, it was the lion that was the national animal. After the Indian Wildlife Protection Act was passed in 1972, the recognition that the number of tigers were dwindling led to then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declaring it the national animal.

A year later, Project Tiger was launched, as an initiative to promote conservation along with habitats for the magnificent beast. The project has been generally considered a success, thanks to the attention it has received in no small part due to being declared the country's national animal.

Dedicated tiger reserves were established across the country under this project to provide a viable habitat for the big cat. From nine tiger reserves in its formative years, Project Tiger coverage has increased to 50 reserves, spread across 18 states. And the country now boasts more than 2,000 tigers.

Last year, the government allotted Project Tiger Rs 380 crore, which was the highest ever, said Union environment and forests minister Prakash Javadekar. (Funds for it dropped to Rs 345 crore in the current financial year, but a complementary increase in funds for development of wildlife habitats softened the blow.)

Now, India is currently home to 60 per cent of the world's tigers and through the establishment of 50 tiger reserves, the numbers of adult tigers living in the wild has been steadily increasing. For the first time in almost a century, there was an increase in the global tiger population of the world, in the 2010-2016 period, and India was a big contributor recording an increase of over 500 tigers in that time.

Aside from an increase in numbers, India has benefitted in other ways thanks to Project Tiger. A fascinating new bio-economic analysis released in July argued that saving tigers makes good economic sense, reported PTI news agency.

In a paper titled 'Making the hidden visible: Economic valuation of tiger reserves in India' in the journal Ecosystem Services, an Indo-Australian team of scientists said saving two tigers yields a capital benefit of about Rs 520 crore. India is home to 2,226 adult tigers, which would mean a capital benefit of about Rs 5.7 lakh crore.

The scientists studied six tiger reserves and estimated that conserving them was equivalent of keeping a secure capital of $230 billion which they call 'stock benefits' of these tiger reserves.

Low-fart cows?

Whether an increase in the population of cows will be similarly beneficial has yet to be studied. One cause for cheer is news reported in The New York Times in May this year - that several government scientists in India ""are working hard to reduce carbon emissions by making cows less flatulent"".

That's a start.

Now if only a modern-day William Blake would compose a paean for the humble cow that's as evocative as 'The Tyger'.",2017-11-27T10:19:00Z
The Times of India,"NGT deadline for Goa, other states on coastal plan - Times of India",Paul Fernandes,"Panaji: National green tribunal (NGT), New Delhi, has set April 30, 2018, for all states, including Goa to submit coastal zone management plans (CZMP) to the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) or face exemplary cost of Rs 5 lakh each.

In a significant order in Shamsunder S Dalvi and others v/s government of India case, the principal bench headed by Justice Swantanter Kumar has taken serious cognizance of the delay, noting that the cost would have to be recovered from the defaulting officer.

""The non-compliance would invite action for violating the orders of the tribunal,"" the bench noted in its order dated November 22, 2017.

While disposing off the complaint and extending the interim order of February 5, 2015, that no construction shall be permitted within 100m of the high tide line in violation of CRZ regulations, the bench also put the ministry on notice.

The bench allowed MoEF to draw its attention to default by any state, but observed that it would not be allowed in future to cite non-cooperation by states, as reason for delay.

Further, the bench directed that the ministry issue approval within three months, July 31, 2018, with regard to fixing of hazard line and CZMP for the entire coastal areas of all states.

""Now if the officers and MoEFCC commit default they shall also be liable to be proceeded against in accordance with law,"" the bench noted.

The tribunal upheld the MoEF stand that the entire development activity out of prohibited area, regulated area and area permitted to development as per CZMP would depend on finalizing it.

MoEFCC had suggested that the states should not grant environmental clearance for development activity within the permissible area/regulated area as that may result in defeating the entire exercise.

The Times of India,"Study: World pollution deadlier than wars, disasters, hunger - Times of India",,"NEW DELHI: Environmental pollution -- from filthy air to contaminated water -- is killing more people every year than all war and violence in the world. More than smoking, hunger or natural disasters. More than AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined.

One out of every six premature deaths in the world in 2015 -- about 9 million -- could be attributed to disease from toxic exposure, according to a major study released on Thursday in The Lancet medical journal. The financial cost from pollution-related death, sickness and welfare is equally massive, the report says, costing some $4.6 trillion in annual losses -- or about 6.2 percent of the global economy.

""There's been a lot of study of pollution, but it's never received the resources or level of attention as, say, AIDS or climate change,"" said epidemiologist Philip Landrigan, dean of global health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, and the lead author on the report.

The report marks the first attempt to pull together data on disease and death caused by all forms of pollution combined.

""Pollution is a massive problem that people aren't seeing because they're looking at scattered bits of it,"" Landrigan said.

The study found pollution was linked to around nine million deaths in 2015.

Dirty air - caused by everything from transport and industry to indoor fires - was the biggest contributor linked to 6.5 million deaths, it said.

The next biggest was polluted water that spread gastrointestinal diseases and parasitic infections and killed 1.8 million people.

The greatest numbers of deaths linked to pollution in that year were in India with 2.5 million, and China with 1.8 million.

Several other countries such Bangladesh, Pakistan, North Korea, South Sudan and Haiti also see nearly a fifth of their premature deaths caused by pollution.

Areas like Sub-Saharan Africa have yet to even set up air pollution monitoring systems. Soil pollution has received scant attention. And there are still plenty of potential toxins still being ignored, with less than half of the 5,000 new chemicals widely dispersed throughout the environment since 1950 having been tested for safety or toxicity.

To reach its figures, the study's authors used methods outlined by the US Environmental Protection Agency for assessing field data from soil tests, as well as with air and water pollution data from the Global Burden of Disease, an ongoing study run by institutions including the World Health Organization and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.

Even the conservative estimate of 9 million pollution-related deaths is one-and-a-half times higher than the number of people killed by smoking, three times the number killed by AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined, more than six times the number killed in road accidents, and 15 times the number killed in war or other forms of violence, according to GBD tallies.

It is most often the world's poorest who suffer. The vast majority of pollution-related deaths -- 92 percent -- occur in low- or middle-income developing countries, where policy makers are chiefly concerned with developing their economies, lifting people out of poverty and building basic infrastructure, the study found. Environmental regulations in those countries tend to be weaker, and industries lean on outdated technologies and dirtier fuels.

In wealthier countries where overall pollution is not as rampant, it is still the poorest communities that are more often exposed, the report says.

""What people don't realize is that pollution does damage to economies. People who are sick or dead cannot contribute to the economy. They need to be looked after,"" said Richard Fuller, head of the global toxic watchdog Pure Earth and one of the 47 scientists, policy makers and public health experts who contributed to the 51-page report.

""There is this myth that finance ministers still live by, that you have to let industry pollute or else you won't develop, he said. ""It just isn't true.""

The report cites EPA research showing that the US has gained some $30 in benefits for every dollar spent on controlling air pollution since 1970, when Congress enacted the Clean Air Act, one of the world's most ambitious environmental laws. Removing lead from gasoline has earned the US economy another $6 trillion cumulatively since 1980, according to studies by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Some experts cautioned, however, that the report's economic message was murky. Reducing the pollution quantified in the report might impact production, and so would not likely translate into gains equal to the $4.6 trillion in economic losses.

The report ""highlights the social and economic justice of this issue,"" said Marc Jeuland, associate professor with the Sanford School of Public Policy and the Duke Global Health Institute at Duke University, who was not involved in the study.

Without more concrete evidence for how specific policies might lead to economic gains, ""policy makers will often find it difficult to take action, and this report thus only goes part way in making the case for action,"" he said.

Jeuland also noted that, while the report counts mortality by each pollutant, there are possible overlaps -- for example, someone exposed to both air pollution and water contamination -- and actions to address one pollutant may not reduce mortality.

""People should be careful not to extrapolate from the US numbers on net (economic) benefits, because the net effects of pollution control will not be equivalent across locations,"" he said.

The study's conclusions on the economic cost of pollution measure lost productivity and health care costs, while also considering studies measuring people's ""willingness to pay"" to reduce the probability of dying. While these types of studies yield estimates at best, they are used by many governments and economists trying to understand how societies value individual lives.

While there has never been an international declaration on pollution, the topic is gaining traction.

The World Bank in April declared that reducing pollution, in all forms, would now be a global priority. And in December, the United Nations will host its first-ever conference on the topic of pollution.

""The relationship between pollution and poverty is very clear,"" said Ernesto Sanchez-Triana, lead environmental specialist at the World Bank. ""And controlling pollution would help us address many other problems, from climate change to malnutrition. The linkages can't be ignored.""

The Times of India,NGT seeks report on extraction of water at Sushant Lok 2 & 3 - Times of India,Bagish Jha,"GURGAON: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed Huda, department of town and country planning (DTCP) and central groundwater authority (CGWA) to submit a detailed report on presence of illegal borewells in Sushant Lok 2 and 3, the source of water supply to the condominiums and their total consumption of water by October 17.

The directive has come on a petition filed by Bala Yadav and Rajendra Goel -- both residents of Sushant Lok-II -- alleging that the developer is extracting groundwater for commercial use. The plea also alleged that the developer, instead of applying for regular water supply connection to Huda, is supplying water in the colony by extracting groundwater for a hefty fee. The tribunal on Wednesday also directed the developer to explain thesource of water supply to the colony. The June 2016 petition also claimed the builder developed the condominiums -- Sushant Lok-II and III -- over around 500 acres of land without obtaining environment clearance, thereby causing immense damage to the environment.

""The developer is illegally extracting the groundwater in huge quantities, and selling it to the residents of Sushant Lok-II and III. The authorities did not take any action against the developer despite repeated complaints,"" Yatish Goel, the counsel for the petitioner, said.

After several hearings, the tribunal in January 2017 had formed a committee, comprising officials of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MOEFCC), DTCP and an administrative official, to visit Sushant Lok. The team submitted its report in February after the inspection, and highlighted that they found four borewells in various locations within the premises, for which no permission from the CGWA was provided.

The CGWA in its reply had mentioned that no permission was obtained by Ansal Buildwell Ltd -- the developer of Sushant Lok II & III -- for ground water abstraction from tube wells.

""The CGWA has declared whole Gurgaon district in 2011 as the dark zone, prohibiting any kind of exploitation of groundwater resource for any purpose to avoid its further depletion in the area,"" CGWA said.

""Illegal swimming pools have also been constructed inside bungalows in the colony without obtaining necessary permission from DTCP. The developer is exploiting and selling the groundwater, and the officials who are duty-bound to take action are turning a blind eye to such illegal acts,"" said Goel.

The developer, according to Goel, has been making monitory gains for several years by causing huge damage to environment. ""Despite finding illegal borewells in the colony, no FIR was filed against the developer by the authorities,"" Goel said, adding that necessary action should be taken against the officials concerned.

A DTCP official told TOI that the town planner had carried out two demolition drives in Sushant Lok in September to clear encroachments in green areas. ""We had carried out demolition drives and submitted the action taken report,"" the official said, adding that the DTCP filed its reply before the green tribunal.

TOI tried to contact the officials of Ansal Buildwell, the developer of Sushant Lok, but they didn't respond to the phone calls, and text messages sent to them. A phone call made to the registered number of the developer's corporate office went unanswered.

Hindustan Times,Green body steps up pollution watch in Gurgaon this Diwali,Ipsita Pati,"The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) has planned to install eight temporary air and noise monitoring units across the city during the Diwali week with a view to track pollutants that risk worsening the air quality.

The move follows the launch of ""Harit Diwali, Swasth Diwali"" campaign by Union minister for environment, forest and climate change Dr. Harsh Vardhan on August 17.

""Every year, we install four monitoring stations that record noise and pollution level for a week during Diwali celebration. However, this time, more monitoring stations will be installed to ensure that pollution data is collated from different locations and action is taken against those found polluting air or creating noise beyond permissible levels,"" JB Sharma, regional officer, HSPCB, said.

The temporary air and noise monitoring units will be installed at Bus stand, Sector 4, MG Road, Subhash Chowk, Civil lines, Sector 50, Sikanderpur and near Galleria Market.

The pollution watch dog also appealed to residents not to burst sound crackers, as it drives the level of air and noise pollution in the region.

""We will also start organising workshops from September 18 to sensitise students on the harmful effects of noise pollution and will motivate them to celebrate Diwali minus crackers,"" he added.

This year, the board is planning to start the awareness campaign a month in advance with an aim to reduce the impact of pollutants from crackers.

The region always grapples with a rise in air pollution levels due to the bursting of sound crackers on Diwali, said the officials. They said that rampant sound abuse during the festival of lights makes it a tough task for them to check pollution and its impact on the environment. Apart from air pollutants, the sound decibels, too, far outstrip permissible levels during Diwali, the officials said.

Every year, pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and suspended particulate matter such as PM10 are released into the air when sound crackers are burst.

Last year, after Diwali, the level of air pollutants in the city rose to more than 13 times than the permissible level. On November 4, 2017, the HSPCB recorded the level of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) at more than 800 µg/m³. The safe threshold for PM 2.5 is 60 g/m3.

This year, the air quality has remained poor for the most part, until recently when it was marked 'average' after the city received monsoon showers. ""We are working to get schoolchildren involved in our effort to reduce pollution. We will be showing them a small video on the impact of pollutants on the environment and urge them to refrain from bursting crackers,"" Ranbir Rathi, senior officer, HSPCB, said.

The low temperature during Diwali and calm air cause 'inversion' that could lead to pollution close to the ground. The toxic smoke mixed with fog causes smog in the region, said officials.",2017-09-03T18:46:00Z
The Times of India,"Yamuna revival: Rs 50,000 fine on city govt, Centre - Times of India",,"New Delhi: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has slapped a fine of Rs 50,000 on the Union environment ministry and the Delhi government for not submitting a status report on implementation of NGT's directions on reviving the Yamuna.

A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar imposed this fine after lawyers representing the environment ministry and the Delhi government failed to appear before it and no report was placed on record.

""Nobody is present on behalf of Delhi and ministry of environment, forest and climate change and no status report has been filed by them. Our order dated August 8, 2017 was peremptory. List this matter for compliance within one week,"" the bench observed.

The matter will be heard next on August 29. The tribunal had earlier asked Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh governments and the Central Pollution Control Board to submit a detailed report on rejuvenation and restoration of the Yamuna in three weeks, saying pollution in the river was of serious concern as it was highly contaminated by industrial effluents and sewage.

It had also directed the pollution control boards of Haryana and Himachal Pradesh to jointly conduct a study on water quality and flow of the Yamuna at the point where it enters Haryana, and submit a list of industries located in the catchment area of the river.

The Times of India,SC seeks information on Karnataka's plea for EC - Times of India,,"Panaji: The Supreme Court (SC) has recently directed the Union ministry for environment, forests and climate change to file an affidavit indicating whether any application has been filed by Karantaka for forest and environment clearance for the Kalsa-Bhandura project in Western Ghats. The court has also directed Karnataka to file an affidavit and inform whether any application has been made for forest and environment clearance.

The apex court's order seeking clarity in the matter strengthened Goa's opposition to the massive Kalsa-Bhandura project undertaken without environmental clearance (EC).

The Mhadei Bachao Abhiyan, an environemtnal group which is fighting the legal battle against Karnataka's move to divert water from the Mhadei river, stated the SC's order has foiled the attempt by the Karnataka government to mislead the court.

MBA stated that Karnataka lied to SC stating that the work was over, and also lied by saying that they did not require an EC. ""The court has recognized that the issue before Mhadei Water Disputes Tribunal and the Mhadei Bachao Abhiyan (MBA) are completely separate. We are concerned only about the forest and environment. We submitted photographs in October to show the court that work continued. The violation is very clear and that is why the court has recognized it,"" said MBA president Nirmala Sawant.

The apex court has noted that the Central Empowered Committee has reported that about 258 hectares of forest land is to be diverted for the project. ""This order is a bombshell. It has reference to constitutionalism, good governance. Unesco heritage status was given to this entire area,"" MBA representative Nandakumar Kamat said.

The response of the Union ministry and Karnataka will be taken up for hearing on August 17.

The Times of India,CPCB too finds Koradi pollution monitoring flawed - Times of India,Ashish Roy,"Nagpur: Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has corroborated the TOI expose' on Koradi Thermal Power Station (KTPS) air pollution questioning the emission figures and Mahagenco's system of measuring them. It has strongly recommended that KTPS should take air pollution control measures for the safety of citizens.

A CPCB team from Vadodara had visited Koradi on June 1 and 2 on the directives of Prime Minister's Office (PMO). Following TOI reports on air pollution by KTPS, activist Ankita Shah had lodged a complaint with PMO.

The visit report dated June 14, was recently provided to Shah by CPCB head office through Right to Information (RTI). It states that the sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions at stack (chimney) that were observed during monitoring were single digit and below detectable limit (BDL) and hence are ""not expected or acceptable.""

The particulate matter (PM) levels at stack were within limits. However, at the time of monitoring, the units were functioning at less than half their capacity. Environment expert Debi Goenka said monitoring should be done only when the units are operating at full capacity.

The report further supported TOI's contention that installation of a flu-gas desulphuriser (FGD) unit was mandatory at KTPS. ""As per the environmental clearance (EC) by ministry of environment, forests and climate change, (MoEFCC), FGD was to be installed. But except for floating a tender, no proper work is reported,"" it said.

The report strongly asserts that Mahagenco that runs KTPS, needs to provide air pollution control system in the three units. ""The plant should be shut down unless all the conditions are met,"" said Goenka.

On online continuous emission monitoring systems (OCEMS), the report clearly pointed out the records were not maintained properly. ""Some of the observed values are not representative and need proper calibration and functioning. Though registration of the system with CPCB had been done, connectivity to the board is yet to be established,"" it said. The report at present is being examined at CPCB headquarters in Delhi.

In April, TOI had visited five affected villages surrounding KTPS where locals were facing various health issues due to emission of fly-ash and other pollutants. Surprisingly, the monitoring results of CPCB team in Suradevi, Waregaon, Singori and Bokhara villages shows levels of all pollutants within permissible limits. According to it, the weather conditions during monitoring were ""cloudy, stormy and light drizzle.""

Questioning the results, Goenka said monitoring should not have been done under such conditions. ""Even a light drizzle washes out pollutants from the air,"" he said.

The team members had interacted with residents of four villages. The report states that Waregaon gram panchayat staff had complained of dust problem due to improper transportation of fly-ash by trucks. A farmer from Chakki Khapa also reported dust problems in his farm. Same is the case with Suradevi.

CPCB team suggested coal handling and transfer junctions should be provided with dust extraction system as per EC condition. ""Fugitive emissions from fly-ash silo should be arrested,"" the report said.

The report criticized the stack monitoring system stating it was not as per Emission Regulations (Part-3) of CPCB. ""It is observed that maintenance lift used to reach the location for sampling is not safe at 80 metre height with darkness and no proper ventilation. The other lift for inspection is yet to be provided and there are openings in stacks from where air can enter,"" it added.

The Times of India,Unmanned drones to keep watch over forests - Times of India,P Oppili,"Chennai: They are ""Eyes in the Skies"". Poaching, tree felling or any other non-forestry activity in tiger reserves will no longer be possible as the woods will be monitored by these unmanned aerial vehicles.

Wildlife Institute of India (WII) researcher K Ramesh told TOI that both the Union Ministry of Forests, Environment and Climate Change (MoEFCC) and the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) have agreed to increase surveillance in tiger reserves using drones. The WII will provide training for select foot soldiers of the forest department on the use of unmanned aerial surveillance systems.

A total of 13 tiger reserves have been identified across the country where drones will be used for surveillance. This includes Corbett, Dudhwa, Kaziranga, Namdapha, Sundarbans, Simlipal, Ranthampore, Panna, Melghat, Srislam-Nagarjunasagar, Bandipur, Sathyamangalam and Parambikulam. Drones were already used on a trial basis in Sathyamangalam for three days in May.

Ramesh said the drones will be operated at random to conduct surprise surveys of the reserves. Areas in the reserve will be covered by these unmanned aerials based on GPS coordinates, which will be configured using special mapping software. The drones will go to these points on autopilot. However, these locations can be modified even while the drone is still in the air, he said.

The institute has permission to use drones for surveillance for three years . The state governments are free to convert them into full-time toold if they wish to do so.

Ramesh said data collected form these drones at the local levl has to be vetted by the Ministry of Defence. Thereafter, it can be used for management of the concerned reserve.

This unmanned aerial surveillance is not meant for tigers alone, but for the overall habitat. So, the aim is to cover as much area as possible with this equipment, he said.

""Drones are not required compulsorily for monitoring the forest areas. It depends on the local requirement and resource available with the state governments. However, two drones per range will be ideal to monitor the forests,"" he said.

Answering a question on the duration of a drone on air, Ramesh said it depends on the endurance capacity of the machine. Technically, the available drone can fly for an hour covering 40km, which can be increased with newer technology. The cost of the drones, which vary from model to model, ranges between Rs 2 lakh to Rs 15 lakh.

The Times of India,Experts implore PM to move cables underground - Times of India,Himanshu Kaushik,"Ahmedabad: The death of one great Indian bustard (GIB) has again raised concerns and wildlife experts are now demanding that the overhead high-tension cables be moved underground especially in parts of Kutch and around the Great Indian Bustard Sanctuary at Naliya.

Wildlife experts have even written to chief minister Vijay Rupani asking him to order Gujarat Energy Transmission Corporation Limited (GETCO) lay underground cables in the Naliya and Lala areas. On failing to get a response from the CM, Corbett Foundation and IUCN expert group on the bustard member, Divyesh Gadhvi, has now written to PM Narendra Modi and the ministry of environment, forests and climate change, asking them to direct GETCO to lay underground cables instead.

Bharat Jethwa, a researcher, says, ""The Lala GIB sanctuary, which a breeding area for GIB has become enclosed in power lines. The government should take action to preserve this majestic bird. This is the time to shift these power cables or we will lose this critically endangered species."" Jethwa further said that the substation of GETCO is within the sanctuary. The government should shift this power station, even it means spending a few crores.

Gadhvi adds, ""Along with Dilip Khatau, the president of Corbett Foundation, Kutch, we have written to the Prime Minister, asking him to direct the Gujarat government to go underground in areas inhabited by the GIB.""

""In the letter we reminded the PM of how he as chief minister of Gujarat in 2012 ordered GETCO to go underground in areas where hundred of flamingos had died. Even in Dholka, Modi as CM ordered cables to be laid underground in the long-term interests of conservation. We have requested the PM to intervene and remove the GETCO power lines from the GIB's habitat.""

A senior officer, who asked not to be identified, said, ""In December 2011, after the Khadir incident, the principal secretary for environment and forests, S K Nanda, had announced that all high-tension wires near the bird sanctuary would go underground. However, since then, except for Khadir and Dholka, there has been no other area where cables have been laid underground.""

The minister for enironment and forests, Mangubhai Patel, said, ""I will have to check the records before commenting on the issue.""

Times View

Given the alarmingly dwindling numbers of the great Indian bustard (GIB) in Gujarat, the state forest department should mandate that all high tension cables within bird sanctuaries and their eco-sensitive zones be laid underground. This is the need of the hour to save the GIB, which is a critically endangered species in Gujarat, lest it go locally extinct.

The Times of India,New sewage plant at Nehru Park - Times of India,,"New Delhi: New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) inaugurated a sewage treatment plant at Nehru Park on Saturday. The inauguration was done by National Green Tribunal chairperson Justice Swantanter Kumar. The treatment plant has a capacity of about 500 KLD.

Lauding the sustainable practices being adopted by the council, Justice Kumar said, ""I am impressed that the council is not just discharging its functions but also endeavouring to do it in an environmentally sustainable manner.""

""I urge other local bodies of Delhi and the country to study this model for replication,"" he added.

Kumar talking about the climate change pointed out that every citizen should act responsibly to ensure greenery. ""Climate change has happened due to deforestation, greed and vested interests of humans. Nature does not depend on mankind but mankind depends on it,"" he said.

While explaining the positive points of the STP, he said that it is based on a green technology namely soil bio-technology (SBT) that has many benefits like no noise pollution, no air pollution, no odour nuisance and no VOC emission generated.

Council chairman Naresh Kumar said that 9 decentralised STPs will be completed within one month. The total 10 STPs on PPP model will be completed within current calendar year, he added.

A senior officer from DMG said they had written to the MoEFCC that they are sticking to the expert appraisal committee's recommendation. The officer said that the increase in iron ore capping will increase the state revenue. ""With more revenue, the state government can take up more development work,"" the officer said.

Recently, the Goa state pollution control board (GSPCB) started monitoring air ambient quality and sought time from MoEFCC to submit comments over increasing the iron ore output cap in the state.

The Union ministry has also sought comments from the various state and central government departments over increasing the extraction capping in the state. At present, the Supreme Court has capped iron ore extraction at 20 million tonne.

Around 10 central and state government departments had been asked for their views on the report prepared by the six-member expert committee appointed by the Supreme Court, which had recommended an extraction limit of 37 million tonne per annum (MTPA) of iron ore in the state.

The panel, in its report, had suggested that the earlier assessed extraction rate of 20 MTPA be enhanced to 30 MTPA.

It had further stated that the limit could be further increased to 37 MTPA ""as the upper limit predicted by our sustainability model"", subject to the state's review of the macro environment impact assessment (EIA) of the enhanced extraction rate.

Recently, the state government had urged the Supreme Court to increase the iron ore extraction cap in the state. The matter has been adjourned till July.

Directorate of mines and geology had urged the mining companies to exhaust the 20 million tonne iron ore extraction capping by March 31.

MoEFCC had carried out the amendment on a pre-condition that the shacks remain non-operational during that period.

Social activist Kashinath Shetye, Aleixo Arnolfo Pereira, Ketan Govekar and three others have challenged the amendment, alleging that non-demolition of these structures would have an adverse impact on the beach morphology.

The shack operators erect their shacks traditionally in September/October at the start of the tourism season and dismantle them in May. Arguments were heard in the matter and the tribunal has fixed the matter again on July 7, 2017. The amendment followed a demand by shack operators about losses sustained by them in erecting and demolishing the temporary structures on the beach.

The state government had pursued the matter with the central government and the ministry had issued a draft notification dated April 25, 2016, for suggestions and objections from the public. The amendment states that the clearance granted to projects under the notification will be valid for five years.

The ministry had sought comments from various state and central government departments over increasing the capping in the state. At present the Supreme Court has placed a cap of 20 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) on iron ore extraction.

The board has informed the environment ministry that, as per their data, the ambient air quality in some mining areas exceeds permissible limits and that the exercise of monitoring and verifying the data is under way.

""In order to compile and interpret the air ambient quality data and to submit comments thereof on the above subject matter, the board will require some time,"" GSPCB member secretary Levinson Martins said.

The Times of India,'Allow mining at Sonshi till further measures are taken' - Times of India,,"Panaji: The Goa Mineral Ore Exporters Association (GMOEA), the main trading body of mine owners in the state, has demanded that the Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) should allow 12 mining leases to operate at Sonshi till measures are taken to control air pollution, caused by ore transportation.

The ore exporters association also suspects that the reading of ambient air quality monitors installed by the pollution control board are not accurate, and demanded that expert agencies, certified by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change, should be allowed to monitor the stations.

On April 28, 2017, the pollution control board put a halt to mining in Sonshi village, as it refused permission to 12 of the 13 mining leases to operate in the area due to air pollution.

""By the time the check (ambient air quality) is done, we have almost lost our season. What have requested (the board) to at least consider allowing operations in the mines, which are within the permissible limits. If you have some issues with transporting, one can say you may continue with mining but cannot transport,"" Glen Kalavampara, secretary, GMOEA, said, besides adding that they require consent to take certain environmental steps during monsoon.

The ore exporters association said that the pollution issue at Sonshi is blown out proportion.

Kalavampara said that the Sonshi issue needed to be addressed on the basis of practical interventions, classified into immediate, intermediate and long-term measures.

The Times of India,'Entire Western Ghats must be declared eco-sensitive' - Times of India,,"Panaji: The notification of nearly 60,000 sqkm (37%) of the western ghat area by central government as ecologically sensitive area (ESA) has raised apprehensions among activists, as they are wary of the remaining 63% being thrown open to unregulated growth.

The ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF) has been dilly-dallying on declaring the protected area due to various reasons, including opposition from states regarding keeping ecosensitive areas out of bounds for industries and other activities.

""If the government thinks wisely of conserving the environment and ecology of western ghats, then it should be 100%,"" Kumar Kalanand Mani of Peaceful Society, a Marcaim-based NGO said.

The protection of the eco-fragile areas of the global biodiversity hotspot can be meaningful if the flora, fauna, and local population is considered comprehensively. ""But, we hope the move of notifying 37% is the beginning,"" he said.

The exclusion of 63% leaves it unmarked and makes it non-ESA. ""This will immediately remove any existing ambiguity on the WG area, giving the go-ahead for all types of projects in the non-ESA area,"" Terence Jorge of EIA Resource and Response Centre (ERC), Goa, said.

The notification has to consider these facts and draw up a plan identification and marking, as well as regulation of activities in the non-ESA area. ""Provision for adding new ESA areas has to be kept and hydro- power projects should not be allowed in the ESA,"" he said.

ERC is one of a few NGOs which have submitted their suggestions to MoEFCC regarding the notification.

The Centre has found it difficult to work out consensus on the issue, with various lobbies opposing the declaration of ESA. Goa government has also toed the line of other states, stating it has not much land for development in future. Madhav Gadgil, ecologist, who had recommended grading of western ghats into three zones said eco-sensitive zones, as a set of rigid prescriptions and administered in a high-handed fashion by bureaucracy, is not the right way.

""Biodiversity panels can also decide about type of nature conservation,"" he said.

The Times of India,Activists demand closure notice to Ankleshwar FETP operator - Times of India,,"Vadodara: City-based Paryavaran Suraksha Samiti (PSS) has demanded closure of Narmada Clean Tech (NCT), the joint venture firm of Gujarat Industrial Development Corporation (GIDC), which runs the final effluent treatment plant (FETP) in Ankleshwar.

The organization has demanded that the 'consolidated consent and authorization' to NCT must be cancelled, alleging that it has ""consistently failed to meet the prescribed norms of GPCB since its inception.""

PSS has issued legal notices to 10 respondents including secretary, union ministry of environment, forests and climate change, chief secretary and additional chief secretary of Gujarat government, chairman and member secretaries of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and the Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) and chairman of NCT.

The notice states that the authorities' inaction to do so will be considered as contempt of the Supreme Court order which was issued last month.

NCT formerly known as Bharuch Eco Aqua Infrastructure Limited, which was earlier a private company, is now a subsidiary company of the GIDC. It is also a joint venture of member industries of Ankleshwar, Jhagadia and Panoli industrial estates.

According to PSS, it is writing letters about FETP's failure to meet prescribed GPCB norms since 2008 but it has not received any response to its letter regarding the issue of non-compliance which it has written on December 12, last.

""We are extremely concerned that MoEFCC and GPCB are openly allowing NCT to consistently admittedly violate environment laws. Even the results of October 2016 to February 2017 indicate that even when moratorium of Ankleshwar and Panoli has been lifted, it is not meeting the prescribed norms,"" claimed Rohit Prajapati of PSS.

FETP's own reports indicate that while GPCB's prescribed outlet norm of ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N) is 50, the actual outlet has consistently remained over 250. Similarly, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) norm in outlet is 500 while the inlet norm is less than 1,000. But the COD levels have also remained above prescribed norms.

NCT receives treated industrial effluent from common effluent treatment plants (CETPs) of Ankleshwar, Jhagadia and Panoli industrial estates and treat it at FETP upto prescribed norms of GPCB before discharging it into the deep sea through 52.76 km pipeline.

The tribunal in its order said, ""It had asked a simple question to the officials of the state government present whether groundwater in the area is polluted or contaminated in any manner. But none of them could answer the question. As nobody answered to the question, we imposed a penalty of Rs 5 lakh on the state of Rajasthan and all concerned departments.""

An officer Ram Kishan Yadav said, in three places the groundwater samples have found been found to be within limits. However, he was not aware of the source of water being supplied in the area. The samples were not collected by him.

""The Central Pollution Control Board in its report of the same area had shown that it is highly polluted. We find the officer of the PHED is misleading the court. We therefore impose a cost of Rs 50,000 on the officer which had to be recovered from the officers' salary,"" said the NGT order

It said it is not satisfied by the reply of the state pollution control board either for not complying with the direction of Central Pollution Control Board.

In a meeting last month, Coal Minister Piyush Goyal requested Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Anil Madhav Dave to hasten the process of green nod to washeries, an official said.

The government had earlier said that challenge is not quantity but quality of the fossil fuel. Setting up washeries at faster rate will hasten the coal washing process and provide quality coal to CIL customers.

The official further said that during the meeting, the coal ministry brought to the notice of Dave the forest area issue with regard to one to two washeries.

Coal washing is a process of separation mainly based on difference in specific gravity of coal and associated impurities like shale, sand and stones to get relatively pure marketable coal without changing its physical properties.

The country has 15 washeries with a capacity of 38 million tonnes per annum.

The Coal Ministry had earlier this year informed a Parliamentary panel that it will establish 15 coal washeries, which will be made operational by September next year.

These washeries will be built in two phases on Build-own Maintain and EPC contract on turnkey basis. Regarding new initiatives taken for quality improvement of coal, the members were informed that from January 1, 2016, it has been made mandatory to supply 100 per cent crushed coal of (-) 100 mm size to power sector consumers having fuel supply agreement (FSA) excluding pit head power plants of Northern Coalfields (NCL) and Eastern Coalfields (ECL).

The Times of India,Countries harbouring terrorists should pay the price: Swaraj - Times of India,,"New Delhi, June 30 () Countries sponsoring and harbouring terrorists should be made to pay the price, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said today, calling for a united global fight against terrorism.

In an address to BRICS Youth Summit, Swaraj said the fight should be carried out without any distinction being made between ""good"" and ""bad"" terrorists.

Swaraj said BRICS (Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa) was shaping the global discourse significantly to deal with a range of challenges like climate change, poverty alleviation and corruption and that it must also work to eliminate terrorism.

""We also need to work and fight together to eliminate international terrorism in BRICS, UN Security Council and its various Committees. This should be done without any differentiation of a 'good' or 'bad' terrorist.

The Times of India,"Call us if you spot a snake, don't kill it: Wildlife rescuers - Times of India",,"New Delhi, May 17 (IANS) Imagine a scenario where you find a cobra curled up in your shoe, a common krait in your scooter cabinet, or a rock python in your apartment. Don't make any move to kill it, say reptile rescuers: Call Wildlife SOS instead.New Delhi, May 17 (IANS) Imagine a scenario where you find a cobra curled up in your shoe, a common krait in your scooter cabinet, or a rock python in your apartment. Don't make any move to kill it, say reptile rescuers: Call Wildlife SOS instead.

Every month, some 200 to 300 incidents are reported in Delhi when people spot a snake.

According to wildlife experts, with snake sightings likely to increase during the monsoon, people should keep calm and not try to engage, catch or kill the reptile.

""Snakes are incredibly important to the ecosystem, they control vermin and rodent population in the cities. They are also apparently the best indicators of environmental contamination,"" Kartick Satyanarayan, co-founder of Wildlife SOS that runs a 24-hour wildlife and reptile rescue helpline in the National Capital Region, told IANS.

Delhi is home to about 13 species of snakes, of which only two -- the common cobra and common krait -- are venomous. The others include Royal Snake, Wolf Snake, rat snake, Common Sand Boa, Red Sand Boa, Common Kukri, cat snake, rock python, Bronze Back Tree Snake, Leiths Sand Snake, and Checkered Keelback.

About 2,400 to 3,000 snakes are rescued in Delhi every year. Places from where serpents have been rescued include 7, Race Course Road, the prime minister's official residence, and Rashtrapati Bhawan.

""Snakes are the indicator species which means that they become the first victims of climate change. In a manner, their presence assures our presence,"" Kartick said.

""We don't realise their importance, while the fact is that without them we will be harassed by the rodents and other pests,"" he added.

Dismissing common misconceptions, V.B. Dasan from Delhi Forest Department said that snakes pose no danger to humans.

""Snakes only get aggressive when they are either engaged, cornered or attacked. They would always try to flee instead of fighting. It's wrong, and in many cases illegal, to kill them,"" Dasan told IANS.

There have been some cases of snake bites but they are exceptionally few.

While many see snake as encroachers, experts say that its humans who have encroached on their homes. ""They are spotted where they had been living, they had always been there. It's us who have moved to their place. Now they are struggling to survive in gutters and drains,"" Kartick said.

He said that unlike several countries, India unfortunately doesn't conduct Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) to compensate for the space taken from snakes and other species living in an area.

""Countries like the US, the UK and Singapore conduct EIA before any project is started, be it an airport, highway or a shopping mall. Under this, species like snakes, porcupines, birds, squirrels and others living at a site are assessed and relocated in a separate and similar habitat, which may be developed for them. This also reduces man-animal conflict,"" said Kartick.

He adds that in India EIA is only based on the vegetation, that too for a very large project, but not on the affected fauna.

Urban spaces also tend to have large population of vermin like rats and mice which attracts snakes.

""The fear people have of snakes makes any human inhabited area non-supportive of them, as they are generally viewed as dangerous and killed on sight. People should be more tolerant and respectful towards this species,"" said Kartick.

He says that snakes are perhaps one of the best friends for the farmers, as about 20 percent of crop is often lost to rodents.

Forest department officials say that snake sightings have increased recently in Delhi. However, this is not a good sign, as more sighting, especially during daytime hours, is attributed to disturbance among the snakes, either because of humans, habitat destruction or modification or due the proliferating rodents in Delhi, often because of poor garbage treatment.

Experts also maintain that the snake population has declined in Delhi mostly due to climate change or killings.

""Snakes are middle-order predators in the food chain, their absence would cause a dangerous explosion in population numbers of their prey like rats, mice and lizards,"" said Kartick.

""We must learn to co-exist. If someone spots snakes around their house, I would suggest they should reach on the helpline 919871963535 or write to us at info@wildlifesos.org. We will help. Just don't kill them,"" he urges.

The Times of India,Hope National Museum inferno acts as wake-up call for all buildings: Jairam Ramesh - Times of India,,"New Delhi, Apr.26 (ANI): Expressing his anguish over the massive fire at the FICCI building in the national capital which destroyed the Natural History Museum, former environment minister Jairam Ramesh on Tuesday hoped that this incident acts as a wake-up call for all buildings.

""I feel very sad and anguished at this incident. All our buildings are fire hazards. I hope this incident acts as a wake-up call for all our buildings,"" Ramesh told reporters.

""When I was the minister of environment, I used to come here frequently. In fact, I had got land for them next to the zoo. About six acres of land I had got for them between Pragati Maidan and the zoo so that they can be relocated. This is not the right location for the museum. But for some reason, the relocation has not taken place. Later on, I had offered them land even in Noida near the Botanical Garden. This museum requires more space. It is very cramped here,"" he added.

Meanwhile, Minister of State for Environment, Forests and Climate Change Prakash Javadekar ordered energy and fire audit of all the 34 museums present across the country.

""This incident is very tragic. The Natural History Museum is a national treasure. I have talked to the fire officials and they are present at the site. We will see and access the loss that has taken place,"" Javadekar told the media after visiting the site.

""I have ordered energy and fire audit of all our establishments all over the country because we have 34 museums, ZSI and BSI, all put together. We will take care that such incidents don't happen,"" he added.

Javadekar also said that the building was on a rented property of the FICCI, adding the ministry thus has its limitations.

""See, the issue is that it is a rented property. It is not our ministry's property and it's a FICCI property and, therefore, we have limitations. This is a real loss and we will access the loss when the building is handed over to us. After that we will see how the recovery plan can be made,"" he said.

The fire broke out in the wee hours of Tuesday at the Natural History Museum near Delhi's Mandi House.

As many as 25 fire tenders were used to douse the flames, which has now been brought under control.

The fire in the museum, which is located in the FICCI auditorium premises, is said to have started from the top floors and later spread throughout building. Some parts of the FICCI auditorium were also damaged in the massive inferno.

The exact cause behind the origin of the fire is yet to be ascertained.

Two fire officials were seriously injured while battling to flames. They have been admitted at the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital where their condition is said to be stable. (ANI)",2016-04-26T07:22:00Z
The Times of India,Apathy sows anger among farmers - Times of India,,"Guwahati: Bhola Nath Deka (name changed), a farmer from Morowa village in Nalbari district, neither has irrigation facility for his farm, nor can he avail of benefits under the Kisan Credit Card, a government scheme that gives poor farmers access to adequate credit. Deka's small land holding makes him ineligible for the scheme.

Like hundreds of poor farmers in lower Assam, Deka hopes that political parties will pay heed to his demands in the run-up to the election.

Insufficient irrigation, collapse of traditional methods of farming, heavy promotion of hybrid seeds instead of natives ones, non-implementation of policies aiming at boosting cropping intensity and double cropping, non-promotion of native types of paddy, lack of policies for landless farmers and climate change are some of the issues farmers have been crying hoarse over for years.

Simanto Kalita, programme coordinator of the Centre for Environment Education (CEE), Assam, a national institution with a mandate to promote environment awareness, said political parties should include farmers' issues in their election manifestos. ""In Assam, traditional methods of farming are dying. There is need for political intervention to prevent this. Climate change is another issue that needs to be addressed,"" Kalita added.

Both farmers and organizations working with them said the preservation and conservation of native varieties of rice through sustainable agriculture, especially in lower Assam, is something politicians needed to think about seriously. With the government's aggressive championing of high-yield variety of rice, there is hardly any scheme for the preservation and conservation of native varieties like Joha, Kola Joha, Mainagiri, Phool Pakhori, Tengre, Samraj, Boka Dhan, Tulsi Joha, Konkoni, Biru, Kajali Bah, Bordhan, Kalamdani, Manohar Sali, Phulgaz and others.

""Irrigation facility is inaccessible in some areas. There are schemes for farmers but making them reach the intended targets is important,"" said Tapan Baishya, secretary of Lotus Progressive Centre (LPC), an NGO working with farmers in Morowa.

""Political leaders should realize that schemes meant for marginalized farmers are not reaching them. Instead, beneficiaries are being selected improperly,"" said an adviser working with another farmers' group.",2016-03-19T07:49:00Z
Hindustan Times,Fault lines over Loss and Damage fund deepen at key climate meet,,"New Delhi: Major disagreements have cropped up between rich and developing countries on the Loss and Damage fund at the fourth meeting of the Transitional Committee on the operationalization of the new funding arrangements for responding to loss and damage being held in Aswan, Egypt.

The agenda of the meeting is to finalise several issues related to how the fund will operate including the location of the fund, funding arrangements, who will contribute to the fund among others. One of the major contentions is that the rich countries led by the US are seeking to locate the fund under the World Bank and are not supportive of the proposal that the Fund be a ""body under international law possessing international legal personality.""

Operationalising the Loss and Damage fund is among the key deliverables at the upcoming UN Climate Conference (COP28) to be held in Dubai this December. The fourth and final transitional committee meeting is being held from October 17 to 20. But as on Thursday there was a logjam on the location of the fund, whether the fund would have an ""independent legal personality"", and who would benefit from the fund.

""A complete standstill halfway through the 4th Transitional Committee on #LossAndDamage (#TC4) meeting in Aswan. 1. Rich nations seem uninterested in operationalising the new Fund to respond to the #ClimateEmergency, for which they are most responsible. Developing nations are outraged by the proposals of developed countries. These proposals shift away from their #ClimateFinance obligations...Developed countries are adamant on the @WorldBank hosting the #LossAndDamage fund. Yet, sources reveal that yesterday, the #WorldBank couldn't assure that its policies would address concerns of access, independence, and accountability,"" tweeted Harjeet Singh, Head, Global Political Strategy, Climate Action Network International.

""Rich countries, particularly the US, promoting the World Bank - which shares blame for the global climate crisis and inequality - as the host for the Loss and Damage Fund is absolutely unacceptable. This arrangement won't provide the new Fund with true independence, will obstruct direct access to vulnerable communities, and will lack full accountability to governments and those most affected by climate change,"" Singh explained.

During the plenary in Aswan several developing country negotiators explained that if the Loss and Damage Fund is located in the World Bank, it will not have a legal personality and hence will not enjoy as much independence in operating the fund.

Another contention is that developed countries want only the least developed countries and small island developing states to be beneficiaries of the fund. ""The rich countries are interpreting the language in a way that it limits the beneficiaries to only these two country groupings and not other vulnerable regions,"" said Liane Schalatek, Associate Director of the Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung Washington who is also in Aswan.

""Developed nations also seek to open the donors to all member parties who are in a position to contribute to the fund. But this does away with the mandate that developed countries contribute for impacts and mitigation as stipulated by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and also does away with the principle of differentiation as captured in the Paris Agreement,"" Schalatek added.

""Developing countries are keen to host the Fund within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change where the principle of equity will be mandatorily upheld. The World Bank's funding is primarily focused on loans, while loss and damage funding must necessarily be grant-based and easy to access. Developed countries are proposing a new set of checks and balances for the Fund to be hosted within the World Bank, but if that is the case, why do we need the World Bank -- why not develop a new entity altogether, under the UNFCCC?"" said Tamanna Sengupta, Programme Officer, Climate Change, CSE.",2023-10-20T02:22:07Z
The Times of India,Changing monsoon dynamics: West Bengal sees 11% rainfall deficit | Kolkata News - Times of India,Krishnendu Bandyopadhyay,"KOLKATA: The monsoon season in West Bengal has left the region parched and dry, with a significant rainfall deficit of 11%. According to meteorological data, the state typically receives an average of 1336.8mm of rainfall during the monsoon season, but this year, the state experienced only 1184mm.

The entire eastern and northeastern region in the country has faced challenges, with an 18.5% deficit in overall monsoon rainfall.A detailed analysis conducted by CarbonCopy and Climate Trends on daily district-level rainfall data revealed some startling trends.

Out of 81,852 district rain days examined, only about 6% registered normal rainfall. The majority of observations, over 60%, showed large deficits or no rain at all. On the other hand, nearly 20% of the observations indicated large excesses, highlighting the volatile nature of rainfall patterns during the monsoon.

""Monsoon variability is definitely increasing. When global warming happens not only means but also extremes will increase. This monsoon will be known for its large spatial and temporal variability and is typical of any year. The issue however is not seasonal rainfall but large intra-seasonal variability with extended active and weak phases. Data suggest this variability is increasing manifold. So, we need to predict this spatial distribution very well and it is very important for us to learn to adapt to this increasing variability,"" said Dr Madhavan Rajeevan, Former Secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences and Climate Scientist.

August emerged as the worst-performing month, with over 76% of district rain days recording large deficits or no rainfall. This situation raised questions about the definition of seasonal normalcy, as the data showcased a stark contrast between dry and wet periods.

The analysis also revealed that India experienced a significant number of heavy rain events, with over 115.6 mm of rainfall in the past five years. In the entire monsoon season, the country recorded 544 floods and heavy rainfall events, with Himachal Pradesh leading the way with 123 extreme events, followed by Maharashtra with 69 events and Uttarakhand with 68 events.

In addition to the rainfall deficit, the region grappled with meteorological drought conditions, despite an active monsoon in September. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) data from June 1, 2023, to October 4, 2023, indicated these conditions.

Overall, the monsoon season for 2023 in Bengal and the eastern and northeastern regions has revealed the unpredictable nature of rainfall patterns, emphasizing the need for effective water management and climate resilience strategies to address the challenges posed by changing monsoon dynamics.

""The monsoon of 2023 is a testament to how erratic, incessant, and longer dry days are the new norms impacting lives and livelihoods, especially across climate-dependent sectors like agriculture. With below-normal levels of recorded monsoon 7 and more than 200 Indian districts being rainfall-deficient it's a stark reminder that the state of monsoon is fissured. As an El-Nino year, 2023 low-intensity rainfall events are normal but what is abrupt is the increase in incessant and erratic rainfall events. 2023 monsoons witnessed more than 30% increase in erratic rainfall events, most centred around agrarian districts. It is imperative to mainstream climate adaptation actions through the adoption of nature-based solutions and by undertaking hyper-granular risk assessments to map, plan and adapt better,"" said Abinash Mohanty, Sector head, Climate Change and Sustainability, IPE-Global.",2023-11-01T13:35:08Z

The Times of India,3 million Indians at risk of Sikkim-like disaster: International study - Times of India,Vishwa Mohan,"NEW DELHI: The Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) that led to disaster in Sikkim may just be an indication of the danger such an event poses to the lives of three million Indians living in vulnerable areas of the six Himalayan states/UTs - J&K, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.

The first global assessment of such areas, done by an international team led by scientists at UK's Newcastle University, flagged in February that India and Pakistan together make up one-third of the total number of people globally exposed to such GLOFs.The study, published in the journal Nature Communications, also underlined that the population exposed to GLOFs increases with distance from a glacial lake.

GLOFs occur when either a natural dam containing a glacial lake bursts or when the lake's level suddenly increases and overflows its banks, leading to catastrophic downstream destruction.

The Himalayan ranges are host to 7,500 glacial lakes. Of these, Sikkim has about 10%, of which nearly 25 are assessed to be at-risk. India's Glacial Lake Atlas of Ganga river basin shows a total of 4,707 glacial lakes have been mapped from their origin to foothills of Himalayas covering a catchment area of nearly 2.5 sq km.

These figures show the vulnerability of the people living downstream, specifically when climate change due to increasing global average temperatures make the glacial lakes prone to outburst.

""Flash floods in the Himalayas are increasingly linked to climate change. Rising temperatures lead to the melting of glaciers, which store vast amounts of water. When these glaciers melt rapidly, it results in glacial lake outbursts and heavy rainfall, exacerbating the risk of flash floods in the region, as seen in Sikkim,"" said Anjal Prakash, clinical associate professor at Bharti Institute of Public Policy, ISB, Hyderabad.

He said the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports have consistently warned of the Himalayan region's vulnerability to climate change impacts, including the heightened risk of flash floods due to glacier melt and changing rainfall patterns. ""These reports emphasise the urgent need for climate action to mitigate these risks and protect vulnerable communities in the region,"" said Prakash who as a scientist also contributed to the IPCC reports.",2023-10-06T01:38:25Z
The Times of India,State Forms Cell To Reduce Carbon Footprint | - Times of India,ASRP Mukesh,"Ranchi: Taking a step towards reducing carbon footprint in the state, the Jharkhand government has constituted a special cell named 'REDD+' under the aegis of the forest department for preparing a state-level action plan and ensuring its execution in times to come, officials said on Saturday.

REDD refers to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and the 'plus' sign denotes the role of sustainable forest conservation.

Additional principal chief conservator of forests (CAMPA division), Sanjeev Kumar, who is made the nodal officer for REDD+, said the maiden meeting of the cell was held on Friday with all key stakeholders under the chairmanship of principal chief conservator of forests Sanjay Srivastava to start its journey to help the state achieve its carbon footprints target. The action plan will, however, take some weeks but some to-do things have been chalked out to begin the endeavour, he said.

Explaining the concept of REDD+, he said, ""It is one of the climate change mitigation options for developing countries under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation through conservation of forests, its sustainable management and enhancement of forest carbon stocks.""

Notably, India submitted its national REDD+ strategy to UNFCCC in 2019. The national strategy is aimed at building on the existing National Action Plan on Climate Change besides working in sync with the National Forest Policy.

""The objective of National REDD+ Strategy is to facilitate implementation of REDD+ programmes in India in conformity with decisions of the UNFCCC, Cancun Agreements, Warsaw Framework for REDD+, Paris Agreement among others,"" Kumar said.

As per the national policy, all states are mandated to form REDD+ cells to devise state-level action plans in conformity with the national programmes.

""Now that the state-level REDD+ cell is in place, we are working on preparing an action plan for indigenous peoples and other forest-dependent communities, sustainable management of biodiversity, alternative livelihoods, equitable benefit sharing of revenues generated from emission reductions, etc.,"" the officer said.

On the outcomes of their maiden meeting, Kumar said, ""We have decided to soon hold a series of workshops to develop a roadmap in consultation with the stakeholders, including local communities for addressing drivers of deforestation and forest degradation, and issues like safeguards for implementation of REDD+ activities.""

He added, ""Discussions were also held for the preparation of reference emission level/reference-level forest monitoring system and developing safeguard information system (SIS). To oversee REDD+ programme implementation, community forestry groups, van panchayats/village forest protection committees among others will be in place. Focus is also on to explore the possibilities of financing REDD+ related development projects through benefit sharing mechanism.""",2023-09-24T04:16:16Z
Hindustan Times,"'MDBs right vehicle to support planet, people'",,"New Delhi Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) are the right vehicles to support the planet and its people as they alone provide the necessary combination of expertise, staying power, low-cost financing, leverage, and knowledge-sharing capabilities, Lawrence H Summers and NK Singh have written in an article that calls for MDBs to first transform themselves in order to transform the future of developing countries.

Summers, a former US treasury secretary and president emeritus of Harvard University, and NK Singh, the chairman of Fifteenth Finance Commission of India, are the co-conveners of the Independent Expert Group (IEG) constituted by Indian G20 Presidency in March 2023 to suggest measures to strengthen MDBs.

Their article, ""The Multilateral Development Banks the World Needs"", published on Monday by Project Syndicate, which features exclusive commentaries of scholars, policymakers and civic activists, stressed on the need to have robust MDBs underscoring global vulnerabilities, particularly of developing countries and least-developed nations.

""The world is literally on fire this summer. Experts estimate that another Covid-level public health threat is likely to emerge in the next generation. Rising interest rates have left dozens of countries with unmanageable debt burdens. And for the first time in nearly half a century, the global economy is fracturing rather than coming together,"" the authors wrote.

On what MDBs should do, the authors called upon them to ""embracing a wholesale culture of change to become more client-responsive, and to operate better together - including through joint financing, risk sharing, and standard-setting"".

IEG has already submitted the first volume of its report ""The Triple Agenda"" to the international body earlier this month and the second volume is expected in October.

MDBs are supranational institutions set up by two or more sovereign states to foster global economic and social progress particularly with focus on developing and least developed countries. Some of the prominent MDBs include the World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB), Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa, African Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and Islamic Development Bank.

In Volume-1, IEG stressed on the urgency to recast MDBs because of rising inequality, poverty, hunger and devastations due to climate change. ""Radically reformed and strengthened MDBs are essential to address the immense global challenges in today's world,"" the report said.

""The welfare of billions of people and the health of the planet, the foremost example of a global public good (GPG), are under threat. To make matters worse, the problems are getting bigger; the SDGs are badly offtrack, with over 600 million people still living in extreme poverty, and there is an intense urgency to address problems of climate change and nature conservation and protection in all countries,"" it added.

In the article mentioned in the first instance, the co-authors said that disbursement by MDBs have not kept pace even as developing countries face much larger financing needs to meet development and climate goals. The degree to which they now transfer resources to developing countries is unacceptably low, they added.

Summers and Singh proposed the urgent implementation of the ""triple mandate"" envisaged in the IEG report -- formally add global public goods (GPGs) to the existing goals of eliminating extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity while addressing climate challenges. GPGs include key issues pertaining to developing countries such as water security and pandemic preparedness.

""Triple the sustainable lending levels of the MDB system by 2030, reaching $300 billion per year in own-account non-concessional finance and $90 billion per year in concessional finance,"" IEG recommended in Volume 1 of its report submitted at the third meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors (FMCBG) in July.

Proposing resource mobilisation through the private sector, it also suggested that MDBs should change their approach in their engagements with the private sector.

""Once the recommendations on leverage and private capital mobilisation are fully implemented, each dollar of new equity could reasonably be expected to support at least $15 of additional external financing for sustainable investments: $7 in direct MDB lending and $8 in additional direct and indirect mobilisation of external private capital. If complementary investments from national development financial institutions are included, leverage would be even higher,"" the report said.",2023-07-26T19:07:00Z
The Hindu,NLCIL signs MoU with TNC India for repurposing mined-out lands  ,,"NLC India Ltd (NLCIL), a Central Public Sector Enterprise (CPSE), has entered a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Nature Conservancy India Solutions Private Ltd.

The Times of India,"Gold, platinum and other high-value materials, worth US $57 billion dumped or burned in e-waste last year, says UN report | India News - Times of India",,"NEW DELHI: A record 53.6 million tonnes (Mt) of electronic waste (e-waste), an average of 7.3 kg per capita, was generated worldwide in 2019, said the UN's Global E-waste Monitor, 2020, released on Thursday.

Globally, the generation of e-waste grew by 9.2 Mt since 2014 (up by 21% in just five years) and is projected to grow to 74.7 Mt by 2030 - almost doubling in only 16 years, showing increasing use of electrical and electronic equipment.

The Monitor, however, presented a worrying scenario where only 17.4% of the total e-waste was collected and recycled last year - it means that gold, silver, copper, platinum and other high-value, recoverable materials conservatively valued at US $57 billion, a sum greater than the gross domestic product of most countries, were mostly dumped or burned rather than being collected for treatment and reuse.

Non-collected e-waste is also a serious health and environmental hazard as it contains several toxic additives or hazardous substances, such as mercury, brominated flame retardants (BFR), and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), or hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs).

""The increasing levels of e-waste, low collection rates, and non-environmentally sound disposal and treatment of this waste stream pose significant risks to the environment and to human health,"" said the UN report.

Though India (3.2 Mt) is the third largest generator of e-waste after the top two countries China (10.1 Mt) and the USA (6.9 Mt), its per-capita contribution (2.4 kg) to the hazardous waste is much below the global average (7.3 kg).

""The recycling figures for India would also be close to the global figures since it is almost impossible to estimate the volumes being handled by the informal sector,"" said Satish Sinha, domain expert and associate director at Delhi-based policy advocacy group, Toxics Link.

Emphasising on the need to have a close and hard look at the Indian scenario of e-waste management, he said, ""The country announced e- waste rule in 2011 and again revised this in 2016, but we are far from getting things right. The major issue has been in implementation and compliance deficits and this requires constant attention.""

According to the UN report, since 2014 the e-waste categories have increased fastest in temperature exchange equipment (+7%), large equipment (+5%) lamps and small equipment (+4%). The report said this trend was driven by the growing consumption of such products in lower income countries, where those products improve the living standards.

On the other hand, small IT and telecommunication equipment have been growing more slowly, and screens and monitors have shown a slight decrease (-1%), explained largely by lighter flat panel displays replacing heavy monitors and screens.

In Indian context, Sinha expressed his concerns over absence of ""good and credible data"", saying it would be tough to create mechanisms to enforce systems and measures in a scenario where there is complete absence of data on total quantity of waste generation, recycled volumes and generation of materials of strategic nature.

Underlining necessity of recycling from strategic point of view, he said, ""E waste is a unique source of rare metals that are critical for manufacturing of electronic gadgets and currently China enjoys a distinct advantage on these metals on account of both primary deposits and mining from waste.""

The UN report noted that the proper e-waste management can also help mitigate global warming. ""In 2019, an estimated 98 Mt of CO2-equivalents were released into the atmosphere from discarded fridges and air-conditioners, contributing roughly 0.3% of global greenhouse gas emissions.""

Noting that the informal and improper e-waste recycling is a major emerging hazard silently affecting health of future generations, Maria Neira, director, environment, climate change and health department, World Health Organization (WHO), said, ""One in four children are dying from avoidable environmental exposures. One in four children could be saved, if we take action to protect their health and ensure a safe environment.""

""WHO is pleased to join forces in this new Global E-waste Monitor to allow evidence, information about health impacts and joint solutions and policies to be made available to protect our future generations' health.""

According to the report, Europe ranked first worldwide in terms of e-waste generation per capita with 16.2 kg per capita. Oceania came second (16.1 kg) followed by the Americas (13.3 kg). Asia and Africa were much lower: 5.6 and 2.5 kg, respectively.",2020-07-02T16:03:00Z
The Times of India,"IGIA achieves carbon neutral status, first in  Asia-Pacific region - Times of India",,"New Delhi, Sep 27 (IANS) The Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL) on Tuesday said the national capital's Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA) has become the first airport in the Asia-Pacific region to achieve carbon neutral status.

DIAL is a GMR Group-led consortium which manages and operates IGI airport.

According to DIAL, the announcement on the carbon neutral status was made by Airports Council International (ACI) during the Airport Carbon Accreditation certificate presentation ceremony held in Montreal, Canada.

The globally reputed Airport Carbon Accreditation has upgraded Delhi Airport to ""Level 3+, Neutrality"", which is the highest level of achievement available to airports across the world.

Carbon neutrality occurs when the net carbon emissions over an entire year is zero. This means the airport absorbs or offsets the same amount of emission that was generated.

""Today, we have delivered on our commitment of achieving sustainable solutions for aviation climate change mitigations made at LPAA-COP 21 (Lima-Paris Action Agenda-Conference of the Parties) last year through carbon neutrality,"" said I. Prabhakara Rao, Chief Executive Officer, DIAL.

""Going forward we are focussing on energy conservation and exploring alternative solution for generating green energy,"" Rao was quoted in a statement as saying.

Delhi airport aims to increase its solar power generation capacity to 20 MW by 2020. DIAL has set up a 7.84 MW solar power plant to reduce GHG (greenhouse gas) emission.

DIAL has taken various emission-saving measures at IGI airport which has led to a 51 per cent reduction in specific GHG emission (kgCO2/Pax) during the last five years.

The 39th ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organisation) assembly, which coincided with the event, also explored avenues of attaining climate change mitigation solution among the member nations.

The Times of India,Activists Slam Police For Revealing Value Of Seized Wildlife Articles | Bengaluru News - Times of India,,"Bengaluru: City police's crackdown on wildlife traders earlier this week in Vyalikaval area has whipped up a controversy in the conservation circles of Bengaluru.

Condemning police action of disclosing the value of seized wildlife items, conservationists have complained to DG&IGP Alok Mohan seeking action against the officers concerned for violating previous orders.

The central division of Bengaluru City Police on Tuesday disclosed that they had arrested five persons trying to sell elephant tusks, sand boa snakes, and deer antlers. Announcing the arrests, Vyalikaval police also gave out the value of the recovered wildlife articles.

The Wildlife Crime Control Bureau under the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF) had instructed all states and police personnel not to disclose the value of recovered wildlife articles, as this would encourage more poaching and smuggling activities.

Wildlife consultant Sharath Babu R, in the complaint to Alok Mohan, said, ""The DG&IGP had sent a circular to all police officers in Karnataka in 2016, restraining them from disclosing the value of seized wildlife articles. However, there have been repeated violations in recent times. We request you to sensitize your police staff against disclosing the value of seized articles."" When contacted by TOI, Alok Mohan didn't want to comment on the issue. tnn

The Times of India,"Wind Speed Drops, Delhi Gets Its Sixth Severe Air Day Of November | Delhi News - Times of India",,"New Delhi: The respite, even if minimal, was short lived. The air quality in the city slipped back to the severely polluted category on Wednesday, the sixth day since November 3 that Delhi has had to suffer air pollution at the ""severe"" level. The AQI, which rates pollution on a scale of 0 to 500, was determined to be 426 on Wednesday, a rise from 390 a day earlier.Several areas in the capital recorded AQIs higher than Wednesday's average, with Punjabi Bagh logging 464 and Nehru Nagar, 461.

There appears to be no relief on the morrow. ""The air quality is likely to remain in the 'severe' category on November 9. The air quality is likely to improve and reach 'very poor' on November 10 and 11. The outlook for the subsequent six days: The air quality is likely to remain in the 'very poor' or'severe' category,"" predicted the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology's air quality early warning system.

According to the weather analysts, the absence of winds caused the aggregation of pollutants, worsening the situation. ""The winds were mostly calm on Wednesday, though in some areas they blew in the north-westerly direction at a speed of 2-3kmph,"" revealed Mahesh Palawat, vice-chairman, meteorology and climate change, Skymet. ""From November 11, the north-westerly winds might catch speed which might bring some relief. A western disturbance on November 11-12 might also bring the temperature down. However, it will only be a marginal drop.""

On Wednesday, 2,003 farm fires were reported in neighbouring Punjab against 1,515 a day earlier. With the number of harvest stubble fires there remaining high, the particulate matter burden in Delhi too was elevated. The PM2.5 index at its peak on Wednesday was 245.6 micrograms per cubic metres against 212.1 micrograms per cubic metres on Tuesday -- around four times higher than the national 24-hourly safe standard of 60 micrograms per cubic metres. The PM10 level was 426.4 micrograms per cubic metres against 393 micrograms per cubic metres a day earlier and over four times the 24-hourly standard of 100 micrograms per cubic metres.

The Times of India,Hyderabad Records Driest October In Six Decades | - Times of India,Donita Jose,"Hyderabad: Hyderabad experienced its driest October in the last 58 years. Data from Telangana State Development Planning Society confirmed that only Bandlaguda received 4.8mm rainfall in October, making it one of the driest months since 1965.

A glance at the historic data from the district shows that in 1965 as well, 0 mm of rainfall had occurred. Historically in the last 73 years, since 1950 when data was being recorded, in three years the rainfall recorded was in single digits.In 1965, it was 0 mm, 6mm in 1967 and 4.8mm in 2023. It is crucial to note that normally, the district receives 109 mm in October and the deficit this year was nearly 98%.

For Telangana as well, this year only 6.5mm rainfall was recorded against the normal of 89.2mm. It also logged the second lowest rainfall ever for October. In 1965, the state had received 0.9mm of rainfall in October. In 1967, 1976 and 1980, the rainfall recorded in the region were 7.2mm, 7.3mm and 9.7mm respectively.

This sharp variation has come as a surprise and shock for most citizens, considering Hyderabad saw some of its worst flash floods in October between 2020 and 2022.

Experts call this phenomenon ""uncommon"" and a result of climate change and changing weather patterns. ""There have been several frequent weather changes across India in recent years. What happened in Telangana this year is a result of the entire peninsular India suffering its sixth driest October in 122 years,"" said Mahesh Palawat, vice president, meteorology and climate change, Skymet weather services.

A Sravani, scientist 'C' at India Meteorological Department (IMD), said this was also a result of El Nino conditions, which lead to fewer low-pressure formations in the Bay of Bengal. ""This year, on one hand, we had unusually fewer low-pressure formations and the ones which were formed instead of coming towards Telangana went north-west eliminating those rain opportunities,"" she said.

They expect a slightly better November. ""Rain is ruled out in the state until November 15, but post that we might have some rainfall which may cover up the deficit,"" Palawat added.

GSPCB chairperson Mahesh Patil said that based on the success of the event last year, international organisations such as the World Bank have expressed interest in collaborating with Goa for the 2024 summit.

The theme for the upcoming summit is 'A step to become net zero by 2070'.Patil said that the event will familiarise participants with the latest environmental protection technologies and solutions.

""Last year, the three-day exhibition-cum-conference had drawn more than 430 industry delegates, over 1,400 visitors, and more than 35 exhibitors of innovative technologies,"" said Patil.

The forthcoming event will be held at Dr Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Indoor Stadium at Taleigao. Exhibitors will offer the latest tech solutions for issues such as waste management, water and wastewater treatment, solid waste management, air pollution control, waste-to-energy conversion, e-waste and industrial waste, refuse disposal and recycling, and plastic waste recycling.

The Times of India,Indian ports must address infrastructural and operational challenges: Droupadi Murmu | Chennai News - Times of India,V Ayyappan,"CHENNAI: The operational efficiency and turnaround time of Indian ports need to match the global average benchmark to exploit the full potential of the maritime sector, said President of India Droupadi Murmu on Friday.

Speaking at the eight convocation of the Indian Maritime University (IMU) in Chennai on Friday, Murmu said, ""India does not figure in the top 20 nations when it comes to the annual port calls.On the list of 50 best container ports worldwide, we only have two. The Indian ports must address infrastructural and operational challenges before they graduate to the next level. The majority of our fishing fleet is yet to be mechanised.""

Detailing the need to overcome several challenges faced by the sector, she quoted as example the fact that ""a lot of container ship cargo is diverted to nearby foreign ports due to depth restrictions. In the merchant and civilian shipbuilding industry, we need to aim for the highest standards of efficiency, efficacy and competitiveness.""

Citing the Sagarmala programme, Murmu said it was a significant move away from port development to port-led development. ""The five pillars of ""port-led development"" envisaged by Sagarmala are port modernisation, port connectivity, port-led industrialisation, coastal community development and coastal shipping or inland water transportation.

Earlier this month, the third edition of the Global Maritime India Summit attracted Rs 10 lakh crore of investment, which will help in achieving 'Amrit Kaal Vision 2047'. Moreover, the Government of India is working to realise its vision of 'Ports for Prosperity and Ports for Progress'.""

She said, ""One of the gravest challenges of our time is climate catastrophe which includes rising temperatures and sea levels. The maritime sector needs to be agile, proactive and swift in adaptation and mitigation of climate change which risks disrupting livelihoods, particularly among vulnerable communities.""

Murmu appealed to the graduating students to have an obligation towards the health of ecology and ecosystem. ""The need of the hour is sustainable and efficient maritime-related activities including shipping. More resilient and greener practices in the ocean are also essential for a healthy ecosystem,"" she said.

""The country's maritime sector plays a vital role in its trade and economic growth, as 95% of the country's trade by volume and 65% of the trade by value is undertaken through maritime transport. The coastal economy sustains over four million fishermen and India is the second largest fish-producing nation with a fleet of about 2,50,000 fishing boats.""

Wondering whether the country has exploited the full potential of the sector, Murmu said, ""In earlier times, conservative apprehensions about crossing the sea cost us dearly. Then, coming out of the yoke of 200 years of colonial rule, we became more focused on continental development, forgetting that the continental development and maritime development are mutually complementary. We, of course, also lacked the economic and industrial resources to fully establish a strong maritime presence.""

Mentioning that the Pallavas of south India had a powerful navy, Murmu said, ""In the 10th and 11th centuries, Chola's maritime prowess and skills were unmatched which spread our trade and traditions to distant lands. Tamil Nadu has been a land of seafarers. There is evidence of commercial and cultural contacts between South East Asia and South India. The Cholas, Cheras and Pandyas of southern India had established maritime trade links with the local rulers of Sumatra, Java, Malay Peninsula, Thailand and China. The people of Odisha, then known as Kalinga, also travelled through sea routes to South East Asia. The tradition of Bali Jatra is still popular in Odisha and it is held in October-November for about a week.""

The President handed over gold medals and certificates to the graduating students.

Tamil Nadu Governor R N Ravi said India had grown from tenth to third economy in the world and ""we will be a developed country by 2047. Maritime and industry and maritime economy will play a role in this journey.""

Union minister of Ports, Shipping and Waterways Sarbananda Sonowal said coastal cargo grew 102% and ports are experiencing double digit growth. He also said that 'Amrit Kaal Vision 2047' would help the country to become a global maritime hub.

In the eighth convocation, 1,944 students from the six campuses of IMU were qualified to receive their degrees, said IMU vice chancellor Malini V Shankar. Of this, 245 students, including two doctorate scholars and a scholar of MS, were awarded their degrees at the programme on Friday. Union minister of state for shipping and ports Shripad Naik and Tamil Nadu minister for higher education K Ponmudy were also present.",2023-10-27T10:15:21Z
Hindustan Times,Explainer: Why Mumbai recorded air quality poorer than Delhi's. All you need to know,,"Also read: Delhi vs Mumbai air pollution: Which city fares better? Take a look

Due to several factors, Delhi has been struggling to safeguard its air quality, the aggravating AQI in the financial capital has raised eyebrows. Although, this is not the first time citizens in Mumbai had to breath more polluted air than Delhiites. Between January 1 and February 17, the AQI in Mumbai remained higher than that of Delhi's for 12 days. Whereas, Mumbai's AQI during last winter registered at 'poor' and 'very poor' for 66 out of 92 days.

However, there had been variations in the data provided by SAFAR and Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) - both centrally-run platforms - due to the difference in the strength of their monitoring stations.

Note: PM-10 and PM-2.5 are air pollutants made of a mixture of chemical species. Particles with a diameter of 10 microns or less are inhalable and can induce adverse health hazards. Particles with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less are considered fine particulate matter, which is a portion of PM-10.

While several reasons are being associated with the current situation of Mumbai's air quality, with the primary cause is believed to be the dust arising from construction sites. Other causes being climate change; road dust and its displacement; usage of unclean fuels in restaurants, dhabas, bakeries and roadside eateries; open burning of solid waste and garbage; and the industries that include those using Ready Mix Concrete (RMC) plants and casting yard plants.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) earlier warned that it will stop all the government and private construction projects if they fail to meet the dust and pollution control measures. Accordint to municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal, construction is going on at a whopping 6,000 sites in the city currently.

As the city officials concluded dust from construction sites as the key contributor, Chahal listed out stringent list of dos and don'ts for developers to follow. Key mandates are to enclose all under-construction buildings in an area of one acre or more with 35-feet high iron or cloth sheets and installing sprinklers at all sites within 15 days, and smog gun system within a month.

The dip in La Nina - the cooling of the ocean surface and change in wind patterns - partially caused a sudden spike in the particulate matter in the coastal city. The dip in the periodic cooling of the sea surface leads to a defers the strong wind reversal from across the sea, keeping the pollutants hanging in the lower atmosphere for longer period.

Another cause of pollution in the city is found to be the displacement of dust particles from roads and vehicles carrying construction debris. As a result, the municipaly officials decided to operate anti-smog guns on 50 to 60 major roads.

Chahal instructed that vehicles transporting construction debris shall be covered properly with tarpaulin sheets and not carry more than the prescribed load.

The transport commissioner has also been directed to take stringent action against vehicles which are past their service life, do not have a Pollution Under Control (PUC) certificate or are overloading.

Cooking at several restaurants, dhabas and other eateries using unclean oils can emit ultrafine particles including oil droplets and condensed organic compounds. Unclean kitchens can also produce nitrogen di-oxide, carbon mono-oxide and formaldehyde in harmful concentrations.

In April, the BMC formed task forces to conduct weekly drive to identify those restaurants, bakeries and banquet halls those were using unclean oils as well as fuels to fire the ovens.

Open burning of solid waste and garbage and use of Ready Mix Concrete (RMC) plants and casting yard plants are among other reasons for Mumbai's poorer air quality.",2023-10-22T11:28:15Z
Hindustan Times,El Niño system may affect upcoming winter season in Maha,,"PUNE: As El Niño is still in its active phase, it is likely to have an impact on the upcoming winter season, experts have noted, adding that El Niño can contribute to an increase in temperature. As a result, there may be a warm winter this year, including in Maharashtra. However, how significant the temperature rise will be is yet to be ascertained, the researchers said.

Anupam Kashyapi, head of the weather forecasting division, IMD Pune, said, ""The El Niño is likely to affect the upcoming winter season. It mainly contributes to a temperature rise. Therefore, the country as well as the state will experience an increase in temperature however it is still not clear how much it will affect the winter season. Moreover, an increase in temperature may also affect the Rabi crops in many areas as crops such as jowar, wheat, chickpea or gram require cooler weather.""

Vineet Kumar, a former researcher from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), said that overall due to the impact of El Niño, Maharashtra may see temperatures one or two degrees Celsius above normal temperatures in the winter season between November and January.

El Niño is a climate pattern which describes the unusual warming of surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. This year, India is experiencing an active phase of this weather system. The El Niño started in July and is expected to continue till the early phase of next year, namely February to March 2024. The El Niño had a significant impact on the southwest monsoon, especially during August when the country experienced a month-long monsoon break. Although Positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) conditions compensated for the El Niño effect, overall rainfall received was on the negative side of normal. Furthermore, the state this year experienced early withdrawal of the monsoon compared to the delayed withdrawal pattern of the last five years. This resulted in comparatively less rainy days during the monsoon phase. Immediately after the withdrawal of the monsoon, the state saw a significant rise in maximum temperature in some areas. This rise was a clear indication of the El Niño impact on weather in Maharashtra, according to an IMD official.

Regarding the impact of active El Niño conditions on cyclone formation in the Bay of Bengal, Kumar said, ""On an average, two to three cyclones per year form in the Bay of Bengal during the post-monsoon season between October and December. However, in an El Niño year, the frequency of cyclones is close to 1.6 (only one or two cyclones). Also, the intensity of cyclones in the post-monsoon season in the Bay of Bengal is about 25% less than normal. As per JTWC data, during the last four decades in El Niño years, only three 'category 1 or higher intensity' cyclones (windspeeds of at least 120 kmph) have formed in the post-monsoon season in the Bay of Bengal. No category 4 or higher intensity cyclones (windspeeds of at least 220 kmph) have formed when there is El Niño.""

Kumar said that IOD too has an impact on cyclone activity in the Bay of Bengal, with negative IOD enhancing cyclone formation in the bay and positive IOD suppressing it. ""This year, El Niño and positive IOD have suppressed cyclone formation and intensity in the Bay of Bengal. As a result, the cyclone activity in the Bay of Bengal this post-monsoon season is expected to be significantly below normal,"" Kumar said. He said that the impact of El Niño on Arabian Sea cyclones is not clear and more research is required in that area.",2023-10-17T01:18:16Z

The Times of India,"Heat spurt beyond tolerance could spell doom for 2.2bn in India, Pak | Nagpur News - Times of India",Manka Behl,"Nagpur: If global mercury levels increase by 2 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the 2.2 billion residents of India's Indus River Valley and neighbouring Pakistan will be exposed to ""many hours of heat"" that will surpass human tolerance.

The latest interdisciplinary research carried out by experts from the Penn State College of Health and Human Development, Purdue University College of Sciences, and Purdue Institute for a Sustainable Future sounds the death knell for humans. The increasing heat and humidity is expected to be so extreme that the global population will not be able to naturally cool themselves.

Researchers modelled global temperature increases ranging between 1.5 degree Celsius and 4 degrees Celsius to identify areas of the planet where warming could lead to heat and humidity levels that exceed human limits. ""Heat stress increases in magnitude and extent with every degree of global mean surface temperature increase, with monsoon dynamics likely to exacerbate heat conditions in South Asia and East China,"" they found.

While impacts are concentrated in eastern Pakistan and the Indus River Valley in northern India in the 1.5°C and 2°C warming scenarios, they expand in the 2°C and 4°C warmer world, with a substantial accumulation of annual hot hours in the highly populated cities of Delhi, Kolkata, Shanghai, Multan, Nanjing and Wuhan.

With increased global warming, people living in India, specifically the Indus River Valley are likely to experience the first moist heat waves and subsequent substantial increases in accumulated hot hours per year. ""These regions would primarily experience high-humidity heat waves, which can be more dangerous because the air cannot absorb excess moisture. This limits evaporation of sweat from human bodies, and also moisture from some infrastructure, like evaporative coolers. Troublingly, these regions are also in lower-to-middle income nations, so many of the affected people may not have access to air conditioning or any effective way to mitigate the negative health effects of the heat,"" said researchers.

Data showed that during an extended period of extreme heat in Pakistan in the spring of 2022, extreme dry bulb temperatures of 50 degrees Celsius also affected the Indian subcontinent.

While dry bulb temperature refers to the ambient air temperature, Indian scientists have been stressing on the need to factor in wet-bulb temperature, which is a measure of heat-stress conditions on humans, as it combines dry air temperature with humidity.

The unfortunate incident in Navi Mumbai, when 13 people lost their lives in April this year, had also led to calls for taking wet-bulb temperatures into serious consideration when issuing weather warnings.

Explaining the connection between rising heat and humidity to public health, W Larry Kenney from Purdue University said, ""As people get warmer, they sweat, and more blood is pumped to their skin so that they can maintain their core temperature by losing heat to the environment. However, at certain levels of heat and humidity, these adjustments are no longer sufficient, and body core temperature begins to rise. If people do not find a way to cool down within hours, it can lead to heat exhaustion, heat stroke and strain on the cardiovascular system that can lead to heart attacks in vulnerable people.""

To stop temperatures from increasing, researchers once again pointed to decades of research indicating that humans must reduce emission of greenhouse gases, especially the carbon dioxide emitted by burning fossil fuels.",2023-10-09T19:51:35Z

Hindustan Times,Citizens identify 110 species in Pune during Big Butterfly Month,,"Pune: Biologists, educators, conservationists and enthusiasts have made around 4,000 observations and recorded over 110 species of butterfly in the district in September, celebrated worldwide as Big Butterfly Month dedicated to the attractive and colourful insect. Pune city was among the top contributors to the national butterfly observation and professor Dhananjay Kothawale of Bhor tehsil topped the list in the country with at least 1,761 observations of butterflies.

Science groups, NGOs, environmental organisations and citizens carry out various initiatives in September underscoring the importance of conserving habitat for butterflies. Over 19,000 observations were received from across the country this year.

Rajat Joshi, co-ordinator of Pune District Big Butterfly Month initiative, said, ""The number of participants also increased this year.""

The butterflying enthusiasts covered hills in and around the city, public and private gardens, forest and residential areas. The common species identified during the month include Common Banded Awl, Lemon Emigrant, Red Pierrot and Common Pierrot.

Butterflies are renowned for their enchanting beauty, intricate lifecycles, and their ecological significance. Their study gives insights into the health of environment, climate change, and the effectiveness of conservation efforts.

Pune is home to over a hundred species of butterflies and apart from natural hotspots like hills, forests, and grasslands, the colourful insects are also seen in local gardens at residential areas. The Big Butterfly Month initiative was started in 2021 to document the species and generate public awareness.

Joshi said, ""Many took part despite widespread rains. Right from the on-field events to uploading the butterfly observations on public portal iNaturalist, the district was a winner. We had six outdoor events, including butterfly walks to ARAI Hills, man-made forest Sipna, Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), Baner Hill, and Kendriya Vidyalaya 1 School at Dehu Road with the help of Narendra Bhagwat, a senior butterfly watcher in Pune.""

Others who recorded observations include Ravisha at fourth rank with 797 observations, Pritam (fifth, 785), Suraj Adsul (sixth, 464), Bhagwat (10th, 222) and Pavan Damoor (13th, 204).

The final report on butterfly observations will be published soon.",2023-10-04T00:46:11Z
The Times of India,Cattle markets: SC refuses to entertain plea challenging Delhi HC verdict | Delhi News - Times of India,"TIMESOFINDIA COM, Oct 3","NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to entertain a plea challenging the Delhi high court verdict in a case related to cattle markets.

The verdict had dismissed a petition which sought a direction to the authorities to ensure no cattle markets are held in the national capital without obtaining prior permission on the occasion of Bakra-Eid.

After a bench of Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Sudhanshu Dhulia showed its disinclination to entertain the plea, the petitioner sought its permission to withdraw it, saying he wanted to file a review petition before the high court.

""That is something for him (petitioner) to do. Dismissed as withdrawn,"" the bench said.

The petitioner, Ajay Gautam, had challenged the high court's July 3 order which dismissed his plea.

In his plea before the high court, Gautam had sought a direction to the authorities concerned to strictly enforce the provisions contained in a May 2017 notification issued by the ministry of environment, forest & climate change on the occasion of Bakra-Eid which was scheduled to be celebrated in June.

He had also sought a direction for ensuring that no cattle markets are held in Delhi without obtaining the prior permission of the competent authorities as stipulated in the relevant rules for Bakra-Eid celebrations.

During the hearing before the apex court, Gautam told the bench the high court had dismissed his plea saying he had not made out any specific case or cited any particular instance where the rules were violated.

The bench said the photographs the petitioner placed before the high court did not show any animal sacrifice being performed.

""Slaughtering must be done in designated places,"" PTI quoted the bench as saying.

""Is it for the highest court now to see what is happening in Delhi, in a particular area...?"" the apex court asked, adding these are local issues.

Gautam said he is not touching upon any religious issue but talking about enforcement of rules which are in place.

When he urged the bench to issue notice on his plea, the bench said dismissively, ""This court can't be monitoring everything which goes on in every part of the country.""

He then urged the court to grant him the liberty to approach the high court with a review petition.

In its order, the high court had said, ""It is needless to state that the state government will adhere to the notification dated May 23, 2017 issued by the ministry of environment, forest & climate change by which Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Regulation of Livestock Markets) Rules, 2017 were brought into force.""

It had noted that the rules mandate registration of the existing animal markets and lay down the procedure for establishment of the new ones, elaborate on the functions of the district animal market monitoring committee, and also prohibit practices that are cruel and harmful to animals.

""Therefore, the present Writ Petition cannot be entertained. However, it is always open for the Petitioner to approach this Court by showing specific instances of violation of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Regulation of Livestock Markets) Rules, 2017,"" it had said, adding no specific case was highlighted in the petition.

The Times of India,New Tech Set To Breathe Life Into One Of City's Most-polluted Lakes | Gurgaon News - Times of India,Bagish Jha,"Gurgaon: Sukhrali lake, one of the most polluted waterbodies in the city, is all set for rejuvenation with the use of new OxTube technology, which will help increase dissolved oxygen level in the pond.

Aiming at providing clean water access, the move will find sustainable solutions to water crisis by leveraging Indian and European know-how and technology.

The lake, which is spread over 3 acres of land, is adjoined by many commercial establishments, schools and hospitals. It is highly eutrophicated owing to pollutants from incoming sewage that has contaminated the lake's inlet source from natural streams.

With a shallow average depth of 2-3 metres, the lake has lost most of its depth due to silting and sludge. It kicks up a stink and has turned into a breeding ground for mosquitoes due to build-up of debris, sludge and silt from the incoming sewage and rainwater during monsoon.

Micro Irrigation & Command Area Development Authority (MICADA) will carry out the project with funds from Indo Nordic Water Forum (INWF), the EU-India water partnership to tackle pollution in waterbodies as well as address water challenges due to climate change in the area.

""Water in the lake will be restored to normal level by improving dissolved oxygen content in the lake using OxTube, arresting eutrophication, and treating or diverting any incoming sewage before it enters the lake,"" said Satbir Singh Kadian administrator MICADA.

""Periodical removal of solid waste accumulated at the bar screen provided near the inlets will prevent their entry into the lake through solids collection trap bags. Other steps like the use of bio-enzymes, sludge digestion at the bottom of the lake and manual skimming of plastic and solid dumped waste will help complete reclamation of the lake,"" he added.

The project will cost around Rs 50 lakh from which Rs 45 lakh will be spent on installation of OxTube technology. Ambassador of Finland to India Kimmo Lahdevirta inaugurated the project on Monday.

""Enzymatic bioremediation and maintaining the microclimate around the lake will be a major focus,"" said Kadian. The proposed solution combines OxTube technology with oxytech reclamation technology for comprehensive lake reclamation.

The Times of India,Kczma Nod To Coastal Plan First Step In Its Finalization | Thiruvananthapuram News - Times of India,Aswin J Kumar,"Thiruvananthapuram: Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority (KCZMA) has approved the coastal zone management plan (CZMP) of Thiruvananthapuram prepared in accordance with the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification 2019.

This marks a major step in what will be a set of procedures to follow before Thiruvananthapuram's CZMP gets finalized. At a meeting recently, the scientists of National Centre for Earth Science Studies (NCESS) presented the draft CZMP of Thiruvananthapuram and Kollam.

As per the minutes of the latest KCZMA meeting, the modifications incorporated in the CZMP after examining the complaints raised during the public hearing were also presented. After a detailed discussion, it was decided to approve the CZMP of Thiruvananthapuram district, according to the minutes.

The NCESS has been told to complete the CZMP report, public hearing compliance report, coastal land use plan and other supporting documents/reports of Thiruvananthapuram district in all respects as per the CRZ Notification 2019 and the guidelines issued by the ministry of environment, forests and climate change.

The report will be discussed with National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management before submitting it to the technical scrutiny committee. KCZMA has directed that this shall be completed before October first week.

It was in June that KCZMA began processing of over 1,500 complaints received in response to the public hearing conducted in Thiruvananthapuram on the draft CZMP. According to officials, changes have been made with regard to high tide line, buffer zones and port limit.

Concerns had surfaced over the demarcation of area as Vizhinjam port limit in the draft CZMP. During the public hearing held in May to discuss suggestions and objections to CZMP, residents and stakeholders expressed apprehensions and raised questions as to why the port limit was marked in the CZMP.

It was pointed out that that no other port limit was demarcated on CZMP published for other districts. In the revised map, the port limit is learnt to have been removed.

Once the technical scrutiny committee approves the map, it will put forward the recommendations and send the report to the state. The state's recommendations will be added and sent to the ministry and will be followed by the final presentation. A detailed report on public hearing, complaints, replies and minutes of the meetings will be compiled as part of it.

External affairs minister S Jaishankar, at the event, said humanity is truly a diverse group, and this is expressed through culture, traditions, heritage and identities. He also noted that bringing the world together has become crucial in today's world.

Olusegun Obasanjo, former Nigerian president; Richard Czarnecki, former VP of European Parliament; Hakubun Shimomura, a member of parliament, and a former Japanese minister; Michigan congressman Thanedar, also spoke at the event. Mayors, former president and prime ministers, ambassadors, and the senators and parliamentarians of the United States were among the attendees.

'Life is too short to keep solving conflicts; keep questioning'

Noting that loneliness, tension, stress and other mental health challenges have become prevalent in society today, he said: ""We all have to attend to that. Don't pass by anyone you find unhappy. Exchange of a few words can transform their state of mind ... Let's commit ourselves again on this occasion to bring more happiness ... No celebration gains depth without wisdom. Wisdom is to recognise we are all unique and we are all one.""

""There is an ancient saying that intelligent people spend their time in coordination, cooperation and uplifting of human spirit. They spend their time in science, literature, humour, music and dance,"" he said.

He said, ""We need to look within. We need three thing. One of those is passion. We need passion for a greater cause and we need dispassion too, to be able to rest. Without dispassion we cannot have good sleep ... We are all dreamers here. When we dream, when we hold on to and work towards ideas - that is passion. But when it gets too much then we have to say just let it be. So peace is also important. And then in between passion and dispassion we all have to be able to say, I am there for you. We all have that attitude. There is goodness inherent in us, and that needs to come up, and that comes when we realise we are one world family,"" he added.

He also said that life is too short to keep solving conflicts one after another, adding ""Conflicts do arise. And we do need to question. Questioning is necessary ... Mature questions bring us depth. They bring compassion and oneness of mankind ... Let us face challenges pragmatically, and dream for a better future for this and the coming generation.""

'Issues like climate change, economic progress cannot be addressed in isolation'

The minister added that globalisation and technology have facilitated our getting to know each other much better. ""No part of the world, no people, no thought process, no culture is today considered too distant. But because our collective living has become more intense, it must also be more harmonious and more collaborative. The big challenges of the day, be they climate change, economic progress, or societal well-being, cannot be effectively addressed in isolation,"" he said.

He said bringing the world together has become more important and with this approach India took up the responsibility of the G20 presidency. ""And our theme, One Earth, One Family and One Future, is represented so well today before us, culturally. I am proud to say that we in India lived up to our responsibility and as a result we have managed to install new energy in sustainable development, in green growth and in digital delivery.""

""While we all endeavor to expand prosperity and secure our planet's future, it is natural that we are confronted with challenges of oppressing nature. Whether it is natural disaster or man-made, conflicts or disruption, it is also important that in an interdependent world we are always there for one another.""

Praising the research work done at IIVR, Mishra said the institute has played an important role in the country's vegetable production scenario. He hoped that planting materials will be easily available to farmers through hi-tech vegetable nurseries which will benefit lakhs of farmers in the state.

The official stressed on the need to make vegetable farming a good source of income and research on important topics like climate change and artificial intelligence,

Speaking on the occasion, state additional chief secretary Devesh Chaturvedi said Uttar Pradesh is a leading state in vegetable production and farmers of Purvanchal are now earning more by exporting vegetables abroad. Deputy director general (crop science and horticulture science), ICAR, New Delhi, Tilak Raj Sharma said India is setting new dimensions every day in vegetable production and last year vegetables worth over Rs 7000 crore were exported.

The programme started with the inauguration of a hi-tech vegetable nursery and plantation on the institute campus. IIVR director Tushar Kanti Behera highlighted the institute's achievements and gave details of the action plan for double vegetable production by 2047.

On the occasion, scientists Pradeep Karmakar in scientific category, Sudhir Kumar in technical category and Manoj Kumar Pandey in KVK category were facilitated for their best work.

The Times of India,A starlight safari in Lucknow's Kukrail forest | Lucknow News - Times of India,Neha Shukla,"LUCKNOW: A safari in the midst of the night and within city limits. That's on the wishlist of wildlife enthusiasts and it's going to be fulfilled in Lucknow soon. It can be considered as the biggest addition to the city's ecotourism circuit in the past 40 years.

In a twin delight for citizens, the Yogi government has given its green signal for the night safari in Kukrail forest and the shifting of 100-year-old Lucknow zoo from its present location to Kukrail.

Kukrail is a green oasis for Lucknow which has been grappling with soaring pollution levels in recent years. So a trip to the area would allow tourists to expand their lungs while enjoying the company of birds and animals.

The Central Zoo Authority (CZA) has also given its nod for the projects. The forest department has begun the process of engaging a consultant to prepare the Detailed Project Report (DPR). The cost estimation of the project will be done based on the report of the consultant. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, the brain behind making this dream turn into a reality, has profusely thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union minister of forest, environment and climate change, Bhupendra Yadav, for their go-ahead to proposals. He said the state government is committed towards wildlife conservation and promotion of ecotourism -- a vision shown to the nation by the PM. The motivation to steer the night safari and zoo in Kukrail came from this vision, Yogi added.

As per the proposal, a total of 2,027 hectare forest area in Kukrail will be allocated for the zoological garden and the night safari park. The development of the twin projects will be done without disturbing the dense area of the forest and by using the maximum open space within the forest area, which is not under any other use. In the safari, visitors would get to enjoy train and jeep rides with local guides. Yogi Adityanath has made it clear that night safari should be developed without disturbing the flora and fauna of the forest. The project will also give a boost to ecotourism in the state and generate employment. It will also serve as a platform to promote cultural, economic and social development of adjoining regions. Environmentalists say the Kukrail project will boost wildlife conservation and increase awareness about wildlife and forests.

Under the project, the government will build a four-lane approach road to the Kukrail forest for easier access and provide best facilities to tourists during the trip. At present, Kukrail has a rehabilitation centre for alligators and serves as a shelter for rescued spotted pond turtles. Kukrail is a reserved forest area spread over 5,000 hectares. In 2013, the then state government had proposed developing a zoo twice as big as Lucknow zoo at an estimated cost of Rs 380 crore at Kukrail. But the proposal was shot down by the CZA which suggested developing an animal safari instead. The Akhilesh government then sent a proposal for safari in 2015 but it remained in abeyance until the Yogi government revived it.",2023-09-28T19:00:48Z

The Times of India,Soyabean Crop Hit Due To Climatic Changes | Nagpur News - Times of India,Shishir Arya,"Nagpur: As farmers complain of major losses to soyabean crop due to yellow mosaic virus, experts from the Panjabrao Krishi Vidyapeeth (PKV) have suggested that the crisis is because of fungal infection triggered due to change in rain pattern.

The state's agriculture department has roped in experts from the agriculture college to probe the sudden withering away of soyabean crop, leaving a yellowish colour. This has happened right at the time of harvest. Soyabean is the second major crop of the region after cotton.

A senior official in the joint directorate of agriculture for Amravati division said experts have suggested that it could be due to climate change. There was a long gap in rains which led to increase in soil temperature. Even the subsequent rainfall did not bring the soil temperature down. Eventually fungus has developed in the soil leading to diseases like collar rot and root rot in the soyabean crop, said the official.

Large parts of Vidarbha have been affected by the disease. This is generally being referred to as yellow mosaic, which is a viral infection and spreads through white fly as the vector. However, opinions of experts differ on the cause.

Officials at Regional Central Integrated Pest Management Centre (RCIPMC) at Nagpur said yellow mosaic has also been seen in the farms where the organization is conducting farmers' education programme.

These are villages in Katol and Kalmeshwar tehsils of Nagpur district. Here as much as 40% of the soyabean crop has been affected due to it. RCIPMC is a central government organization coming under the directorate of plant protection and quarantine.

Standards guidelines have been issued for management of yellow mosaic. One of the measures is use of yellow stick traps for catching white fly, which spreads the virus. Even a small number of white flies have the potential to spread the virus in a large area, said the officials.

Members of the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) at Maregaon tehsil in Yavatmal have passed a resolution to press the state government for granting compensation for losses due to yellow mosaic infestation. Even the cotton crop has been hit due to less rains, says the resolution, signed by APMC chairman Gaurishankar Khurana. ""The yellow mosaic has led to major losses to soyabean growers,"" said Nitin Khadse, a farmer and Congress activist.

The Times of India,"Scrub Typhus Cases Not Limited To Rural Areas, Say Doctors | - Times of India",Riyan Ramanath V,"Bhubaneswar: Scrub typhus cases are now spreading from villages to urban localities as the rural space is shrinking and cities and towns coming closer to the habitat of insects which lead to the infection caused by larval bacteria, doctors said.

Dr E Venkata Rao of SUM Hospital here said there has been paradigm shift in the living conditions with rapid urbanisation. ""If there is habitat change of people, then a similar situation will arise for animals and insects. Urbanisation has led to encroaching of agricultural fields and forest areas resulting in insects being found in urban areas as well. Scrub typhus was earlier reported mostly in villages, with farmers or labourers working in the fields being affected or the ones coming in contact with them,"" he said.

Health department officials said rapid antigen testing is available in district headquarters and sub-divisional hospitals and surveillance is on to test suspected cases. ""Fatalities (if any) are being monitored. In most cases, patients are recovering. There is nothing to panic. People should consult a doctor if fever persists,"" said Niranjan Mishra, director of public health.

He said more than urbanisation, climate change is to be blamed for rise in the number of mites. ""More humid days are providing a conducive atmosphere for growth of mites. There are trees and agricultural fields close to urban centres. Those in rural areas are not the only ones getting infected. The mite is just the carrier while rodents such as rat and squirrel are the hosts,"" Mishra added.

Balangir, Sundargarh, Keonjhar, Mayurbhanj, Kalahandi, Sonepur and Bargarh districts are reporting the maximum number of scrub typhus cases. Patients are being admitted to private as well as government hospitals. ""The extended monsoon, hot and humid weather and unpredictable showers have created a robust ground for mite growth. Ignoring fever and taking over-the-counter medicines to bring down temperature won't help. In some cases, platelet count is also falling drastically. If fever can't be controlled by oral drugs, then appropriate injectable medicine should be used,"" said Dr Bikash Mishra, a medicine specialist.

The Times of India,"Deferred Public Hearing On Gondkhairi Not Held, Kedar Slams Govt And Mpcb | - Times of India",Vijay Pinjarkar,"Nagpur: Congress MLA from Saoner Sunil Kedar has slammed the three-party coalition government and the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) for not conducting a rehearing for Adani Power Maharashtra Limited (APML) underground coal mine at Gondkhairi.

The public hearing on July 13, 2023, at Karli near the project site to seek environmental clearance was disrupted amid strong protests from villagers. The locals, opposing the mine, did not allow the hearing to continue.

As the hearing was deferred by the MPCB, it was expected that a fresh public hearing would be conducted. But even after over two months it has not been held. Normally, if a public hearing is deferred it is held again after removing the flaws.

In the case of Gondkhairi, people protested for two reasons -- the detailed environment impact assessment (EIA) report was in English and not Marathi, and secondly, they didn't want the project.

As per MoEFCC directions, it is mandatory to publish the EIA summary report in the state's official language. APML officials produced the summary copy in Marathi.

However, instead of calling a fresh hearing, the MPCB website shows the disrupted public hearing as normal but has not posted minutes of the hearing.

""The report of the entire public hearing has been sent to the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) through the state government. The MoEEFCC will take a call. Generally, such hearings are held again only in case of law and order problems or natural calamities,"" Hema Deshpande, MPCB regional officer, said.

MLA Kedar, who led the protest against the coal mine falling in his constituency, said, ""The state government has crushed a democratic protest of the people. Not taking another hearing shows the arrogance of the three-party government. They will pay a price for this in the next elections.

""There is no change in my stand against the coal mine. How can the hearing be complete when people's views were not considered at all,"" Kedar asked.

During the same public hearing, former minister Anil Deshmukh too had opposed the project and made a written submission to the MPCB. Deshmukh was unavailable for comments.

The Vidarbha Environment Action Group (VEAG) convenor Sudhir Paliwal said that the proposed mining project falls in the Nagpur Metropolitan Region Development Authority (NMRDA) and an NOC from NMRDA is necessary.

""If the MPCB claims the public hearing was conducted, why is it not making the minutes of the meeting public on its website,"" asked Paliwal.",2023-09-22T03:20:58Z

The Times of India,'Khazans unique combination of different ecosystems' | Goa News - Times of India,Sep,"Panaji: Goa's age-old khazan lands -- created through an intricate system of bandhs and sluice gates to regulate salinity in them for cultivation of paddy -- is not just one ecosystem. They are a combination of different ecosystems and hold immense biodiversity, said member secretary of Goa State Biodiversity Board Pradip Sarmokadam. He said khazan lands can only be preserved through the community with facilitation from the government, and that it cannot be done only through regulation by the government.

""It is proven that estuarine ecosystem is one of the most productive after the coral ecosystem. And khazan land is where the first marshy land meets the first estuarine ecosystem. Khazan land is, therefore, a combination of many ecosystems,"" said Sarmokadam.

He was speaking at an event organised by the Khazan Society of Goa on World Ozone Day, where a documentary on khazan lands, called 'Khanvte', by Goan youth filmmaker Kabir Naik was screened.

Sarmokadam said climate change also seems to be having an impact on the salinity levels in khazan lands.

""If they are preserved, Goa's land masses will be preserved. Its preservation can only succeed through community model with facilitation from the government,"" he said.

Sarmokadam said that it will not work if a government system replaces a people system such as the traditional management of khazan lands through village-level committees.

He said that even though khazans too fit in the ecological definition of wetlands, there are many difficulties in giving them that status. ""At present, in Goa, 15 waterbodies have been notified as wetlands and another 19 are in the process of being notified. Khazan is wetland no doubt. But there is opposition from some intellectuals. When a wetland is notified, they try to misguide people that the wetland will be taken over by the government,"" said Sarmokadam.

Sangita Naik, an IT professional and mother of the documentary filmmaker Kabir, moderating the discussion on khazan lands, said that khazan is the largest manmade system in Goa.

Architect Elsa Fernandes said that khazan lands find a mention in a plate belonging to the era of a 6th century Bhoja king.",2023-09-16T23:12:21Z
The Times of India,G20 Sfwg Meet Finalises Sustainable Finance Report | - Times of India,Rajeev Dikshit,"Varanasi: The fourth and the last meeting of G20 Sustainable Finance Working Group (SFWG) held under India's G20 presidency successfully concluded after finalising sustainable finance report and roadmap here on Thursday.

The two-day meeting witnessed proactive engagement from more than 80 delegates from G20 member countries, invitee countries and International Organisations including World Bank, New Development Bank, NGFS among others. Many other organisations joined the meeting virtually.

The G20 SFWG aims to mobilise sustainable finance to help ensure global growth and stability and promote the transition towards greener, more resilient and inclusive societies and economies. The main purpose of the group is to advance international work to help scale up private and public sustainable finance and in so doing, accelerate the implementation of the Paris Agreement and 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The G20 Sustainable Finance Roadmap, as finalized in 2021, is the core around which the SFWG functions and takes up future work.

Guided by the principle of 'One Earth, One Family, One Future' and in line with our ethos of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam', SFWG during India's G20 Presidency has worked to further global good and create a better planet. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi has stated, it is our collective responsibility not to let the progress towards Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) fall behind and ensure that no one is left behind.

Towards the end, the SFWG in 2023 carried out the work for enabling finance for SDGs along with the mobilisation of timely and adequate resources for climate finance as agenda priorities. The SFWG during India's G20 presidency has made recommendations on mainly on six areas including mechanisms for mobilisation of timely and adequate resources for climate finance, policy measures and financial instruments for catalysing the rapid development and deployment of green and low-carbon technologies.

Other four areas are scaling-up the adoption of social impact investment instruments, improving nature-related data and reporting, G20 technical assistance action plan, overcoming data-related barriers to climate investments. In addition, the members have finalised the compendium of case studies on financing SDGs and the compendium on non-price policy levers to support sustainable investments.

The G20 New Delhi Leader's Declaration 2023 which was adopted in the Leader's Summit held recently, has welcomed the work undertaken by the SFWG under India's G20 presidency.

Earlier, four SFWG meetings were held in Guwahati, Udaipur, Mahabalipuram and Varanasi.

The Times of India,"Mega Start To Kisan Mela, 1.5l Farmers Flock Pau | Ludhiana News - Times of India",Sep,"Ludhiana: With 1.5 lakh farmers from Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan and Jammu and Kashmir making it to the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), the two-day Kisan Mela -- one of the biggest farm-related events in the region -- got off to a mega start on Thursday.

Farmers, rural women and youths flocked the PAU campus that celebrated the development and recommendations of the new crop varieties and production-protection technologies.

Heavy footfall of farmers was seen during live demonstrations and farmers-scientists' interaction at the stalls in addition to the beeline for the purchase of quality and improved seed, planting material, bio-fertilisers and farm publications.

Wheat variety 'PBW 826' was the most sought after by Punjab farmers as they queued up since early morning to purchase the same. Besides, desi flavours (pakora and jalebi) and cultural programme kept the farmers delighted and elated at the mela.

Though it rained heavily in the afternoon, it did not dampen the mood of farmers. Over 400 stalls were set up by various departments of PAU and KVKs and private companies.

In a disappointment for farmers, Gurmeet Singh Khuddian, minister for agriculture and farmer welfare, Punjab, who inaugurated the mela, made a passing reference on the farmers' policy. He said, ""We have received inputs and the farmers' policy is nearing completion which will be announced soon.""

Addressing farmers, Khuddian said, ""For farmers, PAU is a big tirath (pilgrimage) and a vardaan (blessing.""He also requested farmers to make their children familiar with agriculture and spend more time with them in order to keep them away from drug menace. He advised farmers to tighten their belts on the financial front and refrain from making huge investments by taking loans.

During his maiden visit to the PAU fair, Oliver Braedt, regional manager for agriculture and food, World Bank, who was here for the National Agricultural Higher Education project, said, ""There are many challenges, including climate change, disappearing and overuse of water, deteriorating soil health and adapting prices."" Problems were manifold and that was the reason World Bank was extending support to PAU, he said.

PAU vice-chancellor Dr Satbir Singh Gosal touched upon the issue of exodus of youth in search of greener pastures. Advocating adoption of agriculture as profession, Dr Gosal cited examples of NRIs who were motivating their wards to pursue MBA, and practice agriculture (production) as well as agri-business (marketing). ""During NRI Farmers' conclave at PAU, NRI families shared their rich experiences of involvement in agriculture and self-marketing of agri-produce and processed products,"" he said, while lauding the keen participation of 1.5 lakh farmers in the mela.

Dr G S Buttar, director of extension education, while welcoming the mammoth gathering of farmers to the mela, lauded 56 years of successful organization of Kisan Melas since 1967. ""Even during Covid-19, farmers stood by PAU,"" he said, while adding that the university also stood for the farmers during the monsoon fury this year. He welcomed the feedback from 12,800 villages of Punjab.

Amanpreet Singh Brar, member, board of management, PAU, observed that Punjab has achieved a lot, but at the same time lost a lot in terms of soil, water and air. Bemoaning the excessive extraction of groundwater which has led to declaration of 103 blocks as dark zones in Punjab, he suggested use of drip irrigation for water conservation.

Harpreet Singh, a farmer from Gurdaspur, said, ""I had visited PAU in February, March during Kisan milni and mela. This time, I was hopeful that the government would announce the farmers' policy, but nothing happened of that sort.""

Gurdial Singh, director of a cooperative bank from Mansa and a farmer, said, ""The authorities did not make proper arrangements at the mela. There was no water facility.""

Sukhwinder, a farmer from Rahon road, said, ""It seems the PAU's meteorological department failed to predict the rain. It somewhat dampened the mood.""

Website launched

A website of PAU beekeeper association was launched during the Kisan Mela. As many as 700 honey producers are part of the association. The website is sort of an e-mandi where buyers can approach producers directly.",2023-09-15T04:17:39Z
The Times of India,India's G20 presidency under PM Modi 'historic'; guides world to address challenges: Jyotiraditya Scindia | India News - Times of India,"PTI, Sep","NEW DELHI: Hosting G20 was a historic moment for India and the frameworks drafted during India's Presidency will help the world to address its challenges over the next decade, Union Minister Jyotiraditya M Scindia said.

The G20 Leaders' Summit concluded under India's Presidency on September 10.

""Under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi, it has been a historic G20 Presidency. When I use the word historic there are multiple reasons for that and the whole world experienced India.

""India's power and capability of influencing not only minds but also hearts has struck an emotional cord with every delegate that came to India,"" the Union Minister of Steel and Civil Aviation told PTI.

Last year India assumed the G20 Presidency for the first time to steer discussions and initiatives among member countries on challenges related to broad macroeconomic issues, trade, sustainable development, health, agriculture, energy, environment, climate change, and anti-corruption.

Scindia said it was an extremely engaging presidency as part of which events were held from Kashmir in the North to Kanyakumari in the South, and from Gujarat in the West to Arunachal Pradesh in the East and the world experienced a holistic India.

Speaking on the outcomes of the G20 declaration, the minister said there were regular engagements with the Sherpas of the other member countries to build a consensus on various topics.

""I must congratulate our team who were worked day and night with all the other Sherpas. If you look at every paragraph of that text it tells the where the world needs to go over the next decade and how to address the challenges over the next decade,"" he said.

On the other achievements of India's G20 presidency, he highlighted the Global Biofuels Alliance and the creation of a new economic corridor from Indonesia to India to Middle East and to the Europe and said Indian millets have gained worldwide prominence.

The G20 leaders on Saturday agreed to accelerate energy transitions through collective pathways that would enable the bloc to achieve climate objectives.

Commenting on steel sector's plans to meet energy transition goals, he said ""We are certainly a hard to abate sector... but we are rapidly moving towards lowering our Co2 emissions, moving towards green steel...

""Integrity steel producers and secondary steel units are looking at lowering Co2 emissions through multiple processes by making sure that we concentrate on resource efficiency and material efficiency...raw material efficiency,"" he said.

New practices such as carbon capture and its storage besides production of green hydrogen will allow the industry to lower its emissions. Emphasis is also being put on usage of scrap to produce steel, he added.",2023-09-14T08:09:44Z

The Times of India,CM skips inauguration as row hits Chambal riverfront - Times of India,"TNN, Updated Sep","JAIPUR: Amid allegations of illegality in the construction of Chambal riverfront in Kota, chief minister Ashok Gehlot pulled back from inaugurating the ambitious project at the last minute on Tuesday and assembly speaker CP Joshi filled in for him.

A proposed cabinet meeting in Kota on Wednesday was also cancelled. However, the CM will be in the city on Wednesday for the inauguration of a park, said sources in the CMO.

A day before the inauguration, BJP's former Kota North MLA Prahlad Gunjal alleged that the construction had taken place within the National Chambal Gharial Sanctuary and without the requisite environmental and wildlife clearances.

Citing Supreme Court directions and the guidelines of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC), Gunjal said that construction work of any kind could not be done within a radius of 10-km of the sanctuary area without the permission of the committee constituted by the Supreme Court.

The Chambal riverfront has been constructed on the lines of the Sabarmati riverfront in Ahmedabad at a cost of Rs 1,400 crore.

Gehlot, in a tweet, expressed disappointment at his inability to inaugurate the riverfront ""due to unavoidable circumstances"".

Crediting his UDH minister Shanti Dhariwal for giving ""a historic gift to Hadouti in the form of Kota riverfront"", the CM said: ""Hadouti region is lagging behind in the field of tourism, but this riverfront will prove to be a milestone in increasing tourism here and will write a new story for the development of Kota.""

Gunjal, however, released a letter sent by MoEFCC to Rajasthan's chief wildlife warden in July. The letter, written by the joint director, wildlife, said, ""The project activities are taking place without any clearance under the Environment Protection Act, 1986, and also without any clearance of the standing committee of the National Board for Wildlife.""",2023-09-13T00:44:05Z
The Times of India,"Mark Yamuna & Hindon Floodplains, Ngt Tells Noida As It Hears 2 Pleas | Noida News - Times of India",Shafaque Alam,"Noida: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar to identify and demarcate the floodplain zone of the Yamuna and its tributary Hindon and asked for a report in the next two months.

The directions were issued when the tribunal was hearing a petition by Greater Noida resident Mahesh Kumar that was filed in April this year, alleging the Hindon's floodplains in Lakhnawali village were heavily encroached, with more than 250 constructions on it.

In its order on July 27, the NGT bench comprising acting chairperson justice Sheo Kumar Singh, judicial member justice Arun Kumar Tyagi and expert member A Senthil Vel directed the district magistrate to refer to the River Ganga (Rejuvenation, Protection and Management) Authorities Order, 2016 and the ministry of environment, forest and climate change's 2022 guidelines for industries in close proximity to the river for preparing the report.

It will hear the matter next on November 2.

The bench also referred to a second petition filed by Manoj Singh, the owner of a farmhouse on the Yamuna floodplains. The petitioner had urged the NGT to direct Noida to demarcate the Yamuna's floodplains clearly.

In Noida, the Hindon flows for 45.5km and passes through 28 villages before meeting the Yamuna at Momnathal in Sector 150. The Yamuna, which separates Gautam Budh Nagar from Haryana and Delhi, traverses 80km of the district.

Floodplains of both rivers are heavily encroached -- along the Hindon are dense settlements well beyond its embankments while farmhouses line the banks of the Yamuna. The flooding of the Hindon last month revealed the extent of the encroachment, with hundreds of houses getting submerged when the river expanded.

Kumar, in his petition, referred to the tribunal's May 20, 2013, order that stated no unauthorised constructions can come up in the Yamuna's floodplain zone. The order also said any construction on the river's floodplains should be deemed unauthorised and necessary action should be initiated against the violator.

The green tribunal, while hearing Kumar's petition in April this year, directed the district administration, Noida Authority and the irrigation department to take remedial action. The district administration on July 25 submitted that one of the plots -- number 507 -- mentioned in the plea fell within the notified area of the Greater Noida Authority while two others -- plot numbers 652 and 673 -- came under the jurisdiction of the Noida Authority. All three plots, it said, were on the floodplain zone of the Hindon and multiple residential complexes and colonies had come up on them.

Singh told TOI on Wednesday the administration and police had reached the Yamuna's floodplains to demolish farmhouses on June 8. ""We objected to this as there is no clear demarcation of floodplain areas in the Yamuna and Hindon. We have urged the tribunal to direct the administration to conduct a demarcation exercise before they take any such action,"" he said. Singh has got a stay from the Allahabad high court against demolition.

DM Manish Kumar Verma told TOI he was yet to get a copy of the NGT's order. ""We will go through it and take necessary actions,"" he said.",2023-08-24T02:54:46Z
The Times of India,"Pilibhit Tiger Reserve, TSA join hands for turtles and tortoises conservation | Bareilly News - Times of India",Keshav Agarwal,"PILIBHIT: Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) has embarked on an ambitious journey by formulating its inaugural 'five-year-plan' to safeguard turtles, conduct species identification and estimate their populations both within and outside the reserve.

The initiative will be executed in collaboration with the Turtle Survival Alliance (TSA), an international institution headquartered in the United States, dedicated to the conservation of turtles and tortoises.

PTR's divisional forest officer, Naveen Khandelwal, sent a letter to TSA on Thursday seeking its active participation in the programme. ""The decision is motivated by a recent step of the MoEFCC (ministry of environment, forest and climate change) towards the inclusion of 25 species of freshwater turtles in Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act out of a total of 29 found across the country. The proposed conservation plan also envisaged setting up a turtle research centre in the buffer forest area of PTR,"" Khandelwal said.

According to the programme director of TSA in India, Shailendra Singh, the number of Schedule I turtle species in the country was confined to 20 before April this year.

""Uttar Pradesh, which had as many as seven turtle species under Schedule I out of a total of 15 identified ones so far, has stepped up now with 11 Schedule I species. Of the remaining four species, two have been placed in Schedule II and another two categorised as unprotected"", he said.

Remarkably, out of the 13 turtle species, that had been identified in Pilibhit in a survey conducted by TSA in 2005, 11 are included as Schedule I species as specified in the recently revised Wildlife Protection Act, Singh added.

""Of the 29 freshwater species of turtles found in the country, 25 have been enlisted in the red list of the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) due to their reckless poaching and illegal trading. The launching of an integrated conservation plan becomes an inevitable necessity, especially when Gonda-Bahraich-Pilibhit have already been identified as sensitive zones for illegal trading of turtles by the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB),"" Khandelwal said.",2023-08-11T01:20:28Z
The Times of India,'If forests are vulnerable to fires due to tendu then states should ban bidis' | Nagpur News - Times of India,Vijay Pinjarkar,"NAGPUR: Dilip Gode (66) is the executive director of Vidarbha Nature Conservation Socie ty (VNCS) which protects and manages natural resources. Working for the past decade to promote community forest rights (CFRs) granted under the Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006, VNCS was honoured with the Vasantrao Naik Award 2023 which consisted of '1 lakh and a memento. Gode is also the founder member of CFR & Advocacy Process (CFR-LA) initiated in 2011 to facilitate the exchange infor mation and experiences relat - ed to FRA. He has also been instrumental in mobilizing splinter groups of villagers under the Vidarbha Livelihood Forum (VLF) which has a base of at least 300 CFR villages. Gode is also working on community forestry, forest-based livelihood, and conservation in more than 100 villages in the tribal belt of Gondia, Gadchiroli, and Nagpur districts. An ex-member of the state board of wildlife (SBWL), he is on several committees of the state and Central government. In an interview to TOI, Gode spoke at length about the issues that plague forests and the way out.

Q. Why was VNCS honoured with the prestigious Vasantrao Naik Award?

A. The award was for our work on tribal development, water conservation, and creating livelihood opportunities in 75 villages in Gondia and Gadchiroli districts. VNCS has been working with the gram sabhas where a group of 12 gram sabhas recognized with CFRs collected and sold tendu leaves as a federation. This was the first such activity in the entire country in 2013.

Q. In what way have you impacted the lives of people?

A. Our efforts to promote tendu leaves, collection of mahua flowers and fishery in 45 water tanks have enhanced people's income by almost 75-100%. VNCS has mobilized people and resources for the desilting and deepening of 55 community water bodies to promote rainwater harvesting and irrigation. People's agricultural income increased due to the availability of water for 2,000 acres of land. Each family is earning a minimum Rs 1-2.5 lakh annually. The forest has been regenerated with the addition of around 700-1,000 plants per hectare due to protection, ban on tree felling, fire control and minimizing collection of fuel wood. All these activities have boosted the welfare of tribals, ecological security, and livelihood.

Q. Has CFR helped in the sustainable governance of forests?

A. The essence of CFR is recognizing ownership rights over forest and water resources. Under CFR, apart from rights on forest produce, people have been simultaneously given the responsibility for protection, conservation, sustainable use, and equitable sharing while managing those Q. What kind of role does your NGO play when it comes to community forest management? A. Our NGO is helping secure CFRs to the gram sabhas under the FRA through training, awareness, capacity-building and dialogue with the government. Many are not aware of various Acts and rules empowering people's institutions to work on their ownership rights of natural resources. We are helping gram sabhas manage resources for their sustainable livelihood, income generation and good governance. There are many Acts like the Biodiversity Act, PESA, FCA, Panchayati Act, and MGNREGA that need to be understood by people. Q. What are the challenges faced by the communities? A. The challenges include the involvement of people in the planning and implementation of schemes, problems due to climate change impacting the quality of life and agriculture, proper functioning of gram sabhas, their space in decision-making, unemployment and poverty in rural areas, better dialogue with government agencies, benefits through the convergence of state schemes focusing on income through agriculture, forest produce and other allied village level small businesses, marketing support, etc. resources. The sense of ownership would definitely encourage people to protect and manage forests, wildlife, and water resources. Q. CFRs have been mostly confined to tendu and bamboo. What about promoting the other minor forest produce? A: It's not confined to only tendu leaves and bamboo collection, but all available minor forest produce (MFP) including fruits, seeds, food, fodder, medicinal plants, mahua flowers, etc. Tendu and bamboo are in focus because they have big commercial value where people earn a substantial income. Management of other MFPs too has a good potential through sustainable harvesting, value addition, marketing linkages, etc.

Q. Tendu leaves are used to manufacture only bidis which invite cancer. What's your take on the issue?

A. Not just bidis, there are many products sold in the market which are carcinogenic. Bidis have an adverse impact on health like cigars and liq - uor from mahua flowers. Ex - tracting tendu leaves is a poli - cy decision.

Q. Tendu collection is opposed as vast forest stretches are set afire causing huge ecological and biodiversity loss, besides man-animal conflict. What's the solution to this problem?

A. It's true that forest fires are witnessed in summer, especial - ly during the collection of ten - du leaves and mahua flowers. Government departments should be vigilant and book those involved in igniting fires and damaging forests. Any forest fire badly impacts for - ests, wildlife, and ecology. Proper management with pre - ventive measures is required.

Q. It's been almost 17 years since the FRA came into force. Has the Act achieved its aims and objectives?

A. No, the goals have not been fulfilled and hardly 17% area has been brought under the CFR in the country. It is an op - portunity to start people's col - laborative regime if the pro - cess of recognizing rights is implemented in a mission mode. Some small South Asian countries like Nepal have set an example of good communi - ty forest governance through the participation of people as the owners of the country's natural resources.

Q. Do you think that any kind of an alternative can be worked out to replace tendu leaves?

A. Unless the states impose a ban on bidis, the use of tendu leaves will not stop. It's up to the states to ban products that badly impact health and the environment. The collection of tendu leaves will continue till the sale of bidis is allowed. There are many alternatives to increase income through intensified agriculture, fisher - ies, collection, and sale of MFPs like bamboo, medicinal herbs, oil seeds, etc. The gov - ernment has to bring about the necessary changes in poli - cies and provide support to the people who need it.

Q. Do you agree with people's opinion that rights-based ap - proach has gone wrong because of massive encroachments on forest land?

A. This is not true. The spirit of the Act is well-defined with clear procedures to recognize either individual forest rights (IFRs) or community. The problem is with its wrongful implementation. Though the final say is with the gram sab - ha, at every stage, representa - tives of state departments are in the process of recognizing rights. The forest department has land in its possession and there are checks and balances before giving IFRs and CFRs. If encroachments are happen - ing, then why action is not taken, and punishments im - posed? The law-enforcing agencies need to be active and accountable instead of blam - ing people and FRA.

Q. What kind of role does your NGO play when it comes to community forest management?

A. Our NGO is helping secure CFRs to the gram sabhas under the FRA through training, awareness, capacity-build - ing and dialogue with the government. Many are not aware of various Acts and rules empowering people's institutions to work on their ownership rights of natural resources. We are helping gram sabhas manage resources for their sus - tainable livelihood, income generation and good govern - ance. There are many Acts like the Biodiversity Act, PESA, FCA, Panchayati Act, and MGNREGA that need to be un - derstood by people.

Q. What are the challenges faced by the communities?

A. The challenges include the involvement of people in the planning and implementation of schemes, problems due to climate change impacting the quality of life and agriculture, proper functioning of gram sabhas, their space in decision-mak - ing, unemployment and poverty in rural areas, better dialogue with government agencies, benefits through the convergence of state schemes focusing on income through agriculture, forest produce and other allied village level small busi - nesses, marketing support, etc",2023-07-23T04:11:00Z
The Times of India,Bandipur Tiger Reserve Adjudged 2nd-best Protected Area In India | Mysuru News - Times of India,Jul,"Mysuru: Bandipur Tiger Reserve (BTR), which has the highest population of big cats in Karnataka, has been adjudged the second best-managed tiger reserve in India out of 53 such facilities in the country in All India Management Effectiveness Evaluation (MEE) 2022.

This is the first time that BTR, categorized as an excellent protected area (PA), crossed a 90% score in the evaluation. In the MEE survey, Bandipur scored 93.2%, just 1.3 percentage points behind Periyar Tiger Reserve in Kerala, which was adjudged the best-managed PA.

MEE is conducted by the National Tiger Conservation Authority, Wildlife Institute of India and the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF&CC).

P Ramesh Kumar, the BTR director, came in for praise from Amit Mallick, the inspector general of forests (IGF), Project Tiger. Ramesh attributed BTR's success to the frontline employees at the protected area and said this was the reserve's best-ever performance in the assessment.

According to the IGF, India is one of the select-few countries to have successfully assessed its tiger conservation efforts through a globally-accepted MEE framework that evaluated the facilities for five consecutive editions since 2006. The IGF pointed out that Bandipur has shown a steady improvement in MEE ratings, which bears testimony to its commitment towards protecting the big cat population.",2023-07-15T03:13:00Z

The Times of India,Track Electrification Work In Ecr Almost Over | Patna News - Times of India,Kumod Verma,"PATNA: The East Central Railway (ECR) is inching fast towards the completion of track electrification work in its all five divisions -- Danapur, Sonepur, Samastipur, Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Junction (DDU) and Dhanbad.

This will be a rare feat for the East Central Railway to achieve 100% electrification in its divisions to maintain faster connectivity of passenger trains in the state.

According to the ECR's chief public relations officer (CPRO) Birendra Kumar, complete track electrification in the ECR jurisdiction will be a game changer for the railways to maintain an eco-friendly behaviour at a time when global warming threat has been looming large across the country.

""Besides, the railways will reduce high carbon pathway by liquidating services of diesel locomotives which are incurring a huge expenditure on railways,"" he said.

With the diesel locomotives hauled passenger and goods trains are coming to an end. ""Railways will, thus, contribute to eradicate pollution as well as minimise its dependence on imported fuel 'diesel'. Diesel is costlier as compared to electricity, causing emission of carbon which leads to pollution,"" the CPRO said.

Of the total 4,124 route kilometre falling under the ECR, railways has completed 3,910 route kilometre by February this year. Work on the rest has been going on in full swing.

""The ECR has set a deadline to complete entire track electrification work this year giving a new lease of life to railways in 2024,"" Kumar said, adding that after the completion of track electrification the speed of passenger trains will not only increase, but their punctuality will also be maintained.

The railways has increased minimum speed limit of long distance mail and express trains up to 130 km per hour. As compared to the diesel locomotives, hauling capacity of electric locomotives is more.

Tracks on the Jhajha-Patna-Buxar-DDU mainline route is fit to run passenger trains at the maximum speed limit to 160 km per hour, sources said.",2023-05-25T07:02:00Z
The Times of India,"'Powerful' ZP cuts electricity bill, CO2 emissions with solar panels | Pune News - Times of India",Steffy Thevar,"PUNE: The Pune zilla parishad (ZP) is finally reaping benefits of its Rs 52-lakh investment on solar panels done over the last two years, with Rs 6.1 lakh being saved in its electricity bills in the previous fiscal.

The saving is approximately 12.68 per cent of the total annual expenditure and the production is 19.63 per cent of the electricity consumed.

ZP chief executive officer Ayush Prasad said the 57,597 units of solar electricity generated helped avoid emission of about 51,837 kg of carbon dioxide. The amount is roughly equal to the emission of a four wheeler that would run 21,000 km. This is not a mean number going by the climate change the world is reeling under. India has been bearing a major brunt of the damage due to its dependence on conventional fuel sources.

The solar panels are placed on the rooftop of the main building. The equipment covers about one-third of the building's total carpet area. It may be noted that the move has reduced the ZP's dependency on conventional energy sources. The ZP chief has hailed this as an exceptional development.

Prasad said, ""Over the last two years, we have installed 30 large solar panels on the building's rooftop. This has helped us save money and impact the environment in a positive way. The highest power generation happened in May last year - during peak summer - when the panels generated about 6,829 units of electricity against our consumption of 42,197 units.""

He said the solar panels produced 19.63 per cent of the electricity consumed, but, due to shadows and cloudy days, the panels achieved only 72 per cent of its maximum potential . ""It can be higher if the weather is conducive.""

Meanwhile, the Pune ZP has also installed rooftop solar panels at various primary health centres. As many as 18,000 street lights in Pune's rural areas are powered by solar energy. Around 1,100 projects under the Jal Jeevan Mission are set to have solar panels, providing cost savings and sustainable energy solutions.

The body has supported establishment of a unit run by the Swapnapoorti self-help group (SHG) in Bhor taluka to assemble solar panels and LED bulbs.

Further assistance and policy support to such SHGs can promote local employment, skill development and decentralized solar energy production, Prasad added.",2023-05-20T00:45:00Z
The Times of India,Uttar Pradesh's Kukrail night safari gets zoo authority's permission | Lucknow News - Times of India,Neha Shukla,"LUCKNOW: The Central Zoo Authority (CZA) has granted permission for Kukrail night safari and zoo in Lucknow clearing the way for the ambitious project of the Yogi Adityanath government.

It was on April 20, that the technical committee of the CZA gave an in-principle approval for the project.

PCCF and HoD, Forest, Mamta Sanjeev Dubey said that the department will now get a Detailed Project Report (DPR) prepared for which a consultant will be hired.

After the project bagged the in-principle approval from CZA last month, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had expressed gratitude towards Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union minister of forest, environment and climate change, Bhupendra Yadav for the approval.

He said that the state government was committed towards wildlife conservation and promotion of ecotourism, as per the vision of the Prime Minister. Developing a night safari and zoo in Kukrail in Lucknow is part of the same vision of the Prime Minister, he added.

The state cabinet had approved the proposal for Kukrail night safari and zoo in August last year. As per the proposal, the 2027.4 hectare forest area in Kukrail will have both a zoological garden and a night safari park. The development of the twin projects will be done without disturbing the dense area of the forest and by using the maximum open space within the forest area, which is not under any other use.

It was in June last year that CM Yogi Adityanath had issued directions to develop night safari in Kukrail forest by keeping the nature of the forest at the place intact. The project will promote ecotourism in the state. It will also generate employment locally and promote cultural, economic and social development in the nearby regions. Besides, it will boost wildlife conservation and increase awareness about wildlife and forest.

The cabinet also approved the proposal that authorised the chief minister to take decisions regarding the project. There is also a plan to also develop a four-lane approach road, on the outskirts of the forest, to improve connectivity and make it easy for visitors to reach the spot besides creating world class facilities for the visitors.",2023-05-18T15:05:00Z
The Times of India,Jaisalmer: Gib Breeding Centre In Sam Welcomes Four New Members | Jaipur News - Times of India,Times,"Jaisalmer: The Great Indian Bustard (GIB) Conservation Breeding Centre in Sam, Jaisalmer has announced the successful breeding of four new critically endangered GIB chicks including one on Wednesday. The arrival of chicks has marked a significant milestone in the ongoing efforts to conserve the species. Two eggs that hatched were collected from the wild.

Wildlife Institute of India (WII) centre in-charge and chief scientist Dr Suthirtho Dutta said, ""For the first time in captivity, the GIB has bred naturally. Since 2019 till now, eggs were being collected from the wild in Sam Centre, Jaisalmer. The WII team of scientists has artificially hatched and raised those chicks to adulthood and imprinted them, making them capable of breeding without stress in captivity. Furthermore, the breeding season has also commenced for the birds in the wild, with two eggs collected from the wild this year successfully hatched at the Sam Center, too and two were bred in captivity.""

The GIB is a critically endangered species, with only 100-150 birds left in the wild. The largest population is found in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan, in and around Desert National Park (NP and Pokhran. To conserve the species, the ministry of environment, forest and climate change, Rajasthan forest department, WII, and International Fund for Houbara Conservation have joined hands to implement a dedicated project, the Bustard Recovery Program, funded by National CAMPA Authority, which has been ongoing since 2016.

The success of conservation breeding depends on securing adequate wild habitats, releasing surplus captive-bred birds in future, and their ability to get established in these habitats. The Great Indian Bustard Conservation Breeding Center in Sam, Jaisalmer, and the Bustard Recovery Program are playing a crucial role in preserving this majestic species for future generations. Hunting and habitat loss have contributed to the species' decline in the past, while power lines pose a significant threat in the present, as the birds have a poor frontal vision and collide with power lines when flying.

Chief wildlife warden of Rajasthan, Arindam Tomar said,""It has been very motivating to see the rapid progress which the GIB captive breeding project has made since its start in 2019. From creating the temporary breeding center, collection of eggs, birth of the first chick and the birth of the first chick of the captive bred birds; the milestones have come in quick succession. It is the effort, commitment and thorough preparation of the scientists and the local forest staff which has led to this achievement. It has been a great pleasure to see all this happening from close quarters.""

""Former dean of WII, Dr. Y. V. Jhala said, ""Two big milestones have been achieved. Now, two more tasks remain, which are tough ones, which includes rewilding the captive born birds so that they survive when released and releasing them in safe habitats across their historic range.""",2023-05-14T03:58:00Z
The Times of India,Lessons in 'happiness' in schools from this year in Madhya Pradesh | Bhopal News - Times of India,Ankur Sirothia,"BHOPAL: What is happiness - materialistic gain or mental satisfaction? Kids in Madhya Pradesh would now be getting lessons in ""happiness"" from this academic session.

School students would now learn types of emotions and their relations to happiness in their textbooks as part of their curriculum. Thus, MP would become the first state in the country to teach ""happiness"" to school kids. Separate books for Class 9 to Class 12 have been designed with the help of four expert agencies.

Initially, students in 'CM Rise' and 'Excellence Schools' of the state government will get the lessons. There are over 275 such schools in the state. Training of teachers from these schools across the state is underway. Officials claimed there would be no need to make students learn in pieces about time management, stress management, moral values or climate change after studying happiness in schools.

Books have been printed and will be provided to students from July. The syllabus has been designed by the all India council of technical education, universal human values team, MP school education department and Rajya Anand Sansthan or the happiness department. MP was the first in the country to have a happiness department, which initiated the concept.

Attending happiness classes in schools would be mandatory like any other subject. There would also be workbooks that students will be required to do after going through the books. However, the happiness subject would not be part of the student's evaluation process.

A happiness session would be held once a week and will be of one-and-half-hour duration. The books of 150 pages are in Hindi and were named as 'Anand Sabha'.

In Class 9, the students would be made to understand what 'happiness' is, topics like understanding self, relation with one's own body, soul and relationship with self will be taught.

In Class 10, understanding family, concepts like family arrangement and need of harmony in family for happiness will be taught. In class 11, understanding the importance of harmony in society will be covered while in class 12, the students will be made to understand nature and its existence.

The happiness lessons would be first introduced in the MP Board schools and it is called the Anand Sabha programme. The need for the programme was felt as in the current education system, students are taught different subjects, but there was no educational programme on how to live life.

Rajya Anand Sansthan CEO Akhilesh Argal said, ""the students will learn about their relationship with self, family, society and nature in the Anand Sabha. It will help them to lead a better life"".

The Times of India,May need 2.5% of GDP as green financing: RBI - Times of India,"TNN, May 4","TNN

Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has said that the annual green financing requirement could be about 2.5% of GDP to address the infrastructure gap caused by climate events. The requirement could increase if a faster carbon emission-reducing goal has to be pursued than what is committed under the national determined contribution (NDC).

The RBI on Wednesday released its annual report on currency and finance, which has 'Towards a Greener and Cleaner India' as a theme. According to the report, India's goal of achieving the net zero target by 2070 would require an accelerated reduction in the energy intensity of GDP by around 5% annually and a significant improvement in its energy mix in favour of renewables to about 80% by 2070-71.

""Climate change induced risks to macro-financial prospects of the country and the range of policy options available to mitigate climate risks require dedicated research. Such research becomes even more critical in the context of the complexity and non-linearity of the ways in which climate, economy, financial systems and related policies operate,"" RBI governor Shaktikanta Das said in a foreword to the report.

""The financial sector faces the dual challenge of recalibrating its operations and business strategies to support the green transition process while also strengthening resilience to rising vulnerability to adverse climate events to safeguard financial stability,"" the report said. ""On the second challenge, results of a climate stress test reveal that public sector banks (PSBs) may be more vulnerable than private sector banks (PVBs) in India,"" the report said.

According to the report globally, measurement of climate-related financial risks remains a work in progress. ""A pilot survey of key stakeholders in the financial system in India suggests that notwithstanding rising awareness about climate risks and their potential impact on the financial health of entities, risk mitigation plans are largely at the discussion stage and yet to be widely implemented,"" the report said.",2023-05-04T01:43:00Z
The Times of India,Uttarakhand HC directs inclusion of activists in panel to curb illegal mining | Dehradun News - Times of India,"Updated Apr, TNN","DEHRADUN: The Uttarakhand high court (HC) has ordered the state government to reconstitute its committee overseeing illegal mining in the state's river by including environmental experts, activists, retired judicial officers and bureaucrats.

The committee, ordered last December and constituted last month, had the district magistrate (DM), forest and mining officer, the regional transport officer (RTO), and a public representative nominated by the DM.

""Such complaints cannot be left for examination and disposal by the very same authorities who are involved in the matter of enforcement of conditions of the mining license,"" the court said and directed the state government to place details of the reconstituted committee before the court by May 4.

Kankhal-based Matri Sadan has filed a PIL in the matter of sand mining on river Ganga in Kumbh zone between Raiwala to Bhogpur. Taking note of the impact of mining on the river's morphology and ecology, the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change was ordered to file its affidavit earlier this year on February 23.

In its affidavit, the ministry stated that during the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC) meeting, it was recommended that no mining activity will be undertaken in the said area until the EAC reviews the final report submitted by IIT Kanpur.

The court has already directed the state government in its order of December 15, 2022 that ""it is absolutely essential to set up an independent complaint redressal system to look into the complaints of illegal mining. The redressal mechanism should remain independent and unconnected with the state's administration, if it has to work effectively and meaningfully"".

During the hearing, an order of March 22 was placed which stated that the government has ordered the formation of an anti-illegal mining force in each district consisting of DM, SSP, DFO, mining officer, RTO and a person nominated by DM.

The court observed, ""Office order does not address the aspects we have taken note of in our December 15, 2022 order. The state should reconstitute its committee with inclusion of independent and reputed retired members from judiciary and bureaucracy. The committee should necessarily include environmental experts and activists."" Pankul Sharma",2023-04-23T01:21:00Z
Hindustan Times,BBOSE to conduct 10th board examination through BSEB in June,,"The Bihar Board of Open Schooling and Examination ( BBOSE) will organise the Class 10 board examination in June mid-week through the Bihar School Examination board (BSEB), as part of an exercise to revamp the autonomous body following detection of several irregularities earlier this year.

Sources said the conduct of 10th board examination for willing candidates - those who are not regular school students, dropouts or have not completed matric - through the BSEB is a bid to bring in transparency.

Willing students have to take admission to the board and enroll for the examination, which is conducted twice in a year. Last year the examination in December was delayed due to irregularities detected following a vigilance raid, officials said.

""Around 17,000 students have taken admission for the tenth board in November. We will be conducting the examination this time through BSEB so as to bring in transparency in the examination system. This is being done for one time only,"" said special secretary, environment and climate change and chief executive officer (CEO), BBOSE, Om Prakash Yadav.

The revamp of BBOSE is being done following detection of gross irregularities in conduct of examination , issuance of certificates and manipulation in enrollment by staff of the organisation. A vigilance team had raided the BBOSE premises following complaints and arrested five persons on charges of alleged irregularities, officials said.

""In the last few months, we have set a new system where conduct of examination, evaluation and tabulation of marks of students appearing for tenth board would be done as per standard operating procedure(SOP) of BSEB,"" said Yadav. He said the board would issue certificates after due verification and put the documents in digilocker for facilitating students to get it in digital form easily.

The Times of India,Redefining the power balance between the West and the East,Dr J P Gupta,"M.Tech (IIT Delhi), Ph.D. (Toronto), Distinguished Scientist and Environmentalist

The US Foreign Secretary, Mr. Antony J. Blinken, spoke at the G20 Foreign Ministers' meeting recently and said the US and NATO would continue supplying arms and aid to Ukraine until Russia is defeated.

The United States was quick to take advantage of the fragmented power structure of the Eastern Block. Through military aid, economic sanctions, and diplomatic pressure, the US has sought to weaken Russia's position in the region and bolster its own strategic interests. This has included providing military aid to Ukraine, imposing economic sanctions on Russia, and increasing its military presence in the region.

However, while the US has been successful in countering Russian influence in the former satellite states of Eastern Europe, its approach has contributed to the escalating conflict in the region. The support of the US for Ukraine has emboldened its government to take a more aggressive stance towards Russia, leading to an extreme level of human tragedy over the past 12 months. The UN estimated that 8.1 million Ukrainians have been displaced since February 2022, and there have been an estimated 200,000 military fatalities. In addition to the human cost, the war is severely impacting the global economy due to the sanctions put in place by the West. The world economy has endured skyrocketing energy prices and a sharp decline in the production of fertilizers and food which are produced in that region.

The sanctions imposed by the West on any country doing business with Russia is causing significant disruption in the global supply chain. What right do the US and NATO countries have to impose such rulings without a UN mandate? The West, specifically the US, has continued to pressure India to support the sanctions levied against Russia. However, our Hon'ble Prime Minister has not bowed to their threats and intimidation. The two countries have enjoyed a very close relationship since the 1950s, have collaborated on military and security-related matters, and are interested in maintaining a multipolar world order. India and Russia also have strong economic ties and cooperate in various areas, such as energy, trade and investment, space, and technology.

When thinking about a more sustainable solution to the conflict in Ukraine, what is required is a dramatic shift toward a more balanced global power structure. This could be achieved through a partnership between Russia, India, China, and Japan, which would help to create a new world order. Such a partnership would not only help to reduce tensions between the West and the East, but it would also promote greater cooperation and collaboration on trade, security, and climate change issues.

A partnership between these four countries would strategically benefit all the parties. From a macro level, a coalition would lead to the formation of a larger market, with a combined population of more than three billion people, providing increased economic opportunities for all involved.

Individually each country would also see many advantages. Russia would benefit from increased trade and investment with Asia. In today's globalized world, countries are increasingly interconnected and interdependent. Economic, political, and social developments in one country can have far-reaching impacts on other countries. Thus, it is in Russia's best interest to engage with other nations and participate in international organizations to ensure its own economic prosperity and security, as well as to contribute to the stability and progress of the world as a whole. Similarly, it can be argued that China's continued isolation and threats of sanctions from the West would harm its economy and hinder its progress. As Xi Jinping enters his third term in charge, he needs to be willing to prioritize peace with his neighboring countries. China's uncompromising attitude to using force to settle a boundary dispute with India has pushed India to move towards the US for a strategic defense partnership. Similarly, its dispute with Japan and Taiwan drives both countries to align with the West. China should project itself as a peace-seeking nation. It has already used its influence to bring Iran and Saudi Arabia together, and they have a close relationship with Pakistan. If China was to bring its neighboring countries into one union, it would greatly reduce the risk of future global conflicts.

For India, a coalition could deliver increased trade and investment. It would also help in resolving the long and complex history with China. A peace treaty could lead to more productive negotiations on issues of mutual concern, such as climate change and regional security. Furthermore, it would reduce military tensions between the two countries, potentially reducing military spending and a greater focus on social and economic development. While it is a complex situation to resolve, Indian Prime Minister, Narender Modi, has emphasized that peace and tranquility in the border area is an essential prerequisite for normalizing relations. Modi's leadership offers a unique opportunity to settle the boundary disputes with China and also with Pakistan, as he is the most strategic leader India has had since gaining its Independence. As for Japan, along with the economic benefits, a coalition between the four countries could help address regional security concerns, such as terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and maritime security.

While this war ravages parts of Eastern Europe, the US continues to monitor China, which they see as an extreme threat to the West's global influence and power struggle. US regard China as its primary rival and the most consequential geopolitical challenge. China poses a formidable challenge to the US economically, technologically, politically, and militarily around the world. The Chinese Government must act decisively in bringing their neighboring countries together to create peace and unity. If they fail to do so, the US will look to deepen its relationship with the Quad, a strategic forum comprising the United States, Japan, India, and Australia. It was formed in 2007 but was largely inactive for several years. In recent years, however, the Quad has gained renewed importance in promoting regional security and countering Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific region. The US has been a key driver behind the Quad's recent expansion and increased activity. The Biden administration has made strengthening ties with allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific a top priority, and the Quad fits into this broader strategy. The US sees the Quad as a way to promote a free and open Indo-Pacific, one that China does not dominate.",2023-04-18T13:59:00Z
The Times of India,"Pollution board, CII to help Goa biz adopt green ratings | Goa News - Times of India","Updated Apr, TNN","Panaji: Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) has tied up with Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) to adopt GreenCo ratings, which will encourage and assist industrial units to adopt environmentally sustainable practices. GSPCB has also announced a scheme to recognise manufacturing units that pursue the GreenCo certification.

CII's GreenCo ratings are a ""first of its kind"" system that assesses the steps taken by companies to reduce environmental damage and to adopt green and sustainable practices.

The implementation of GreenCo ratings will help create a green industry landscape in Goa, where industries will perform beyond the regulatory norms and work towards achieving aspirational goals, said CII in a statement.

Chairman of GSPCB Mahesh Patil and GSPCB member secretary Shamila Monteiro launched the green ratings system and also announced a ""recognition scheme for participating industries"" that sign up for the ratings.

The green ratings are recognised by the Centre through the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) as an industry contributor to climate mitigation efforts. The United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) has recognised GreenCo as one of the Top 50 global best practices facilitating green growth of industries, said chairman of CII's Goa state council Anirudh Agarwal.

CII said that the GreenCo ratings have been adopted by more than 900 organisations.

""Collectively, they have reported savings of Rs 3,400 crore and a reduction of 3 million metric tonnes of carbon or CO2 equivalent emissions,"" he said.

GSPCB has urged Goan industrial units to participate in the GreenCo rating programme. ""The adoption of GreenCo ratings by industries will promote the efficient use of natural resources, reduction in pollution and waste, reduction in carbon emissions, and help industries attain world-class standards in environmental management,"" said Agarwal. ""It will also help Goa head towards a greener economy and emerge as a low-carbon state in the country.""",2023-04-13T19:45:00Z

""We have had very constructive and positive discussions. We have already got 99%. The other 1% is not in India's hands, someone else has created that. Everyone, emerging markets, developed countries, G7, all want to make India's presidency a success. It's a question of timing,"" India's sherpa Amitabh Kant said after the conclusion of the second meeting of interlocutors from the 20 largest economies.

While several countries have indicated their support to reform the World Bank and similar entities, address the issue of climate change and debt problems of some of the developing and poor nations, China and Russia have concerns over the way the US and European countries are approaching the Ukraine crisis. The gulf has resulted in the finance ministers and central bank governors and foreign ministers being unable to issue a joint communique and have instead issued a chair's summary.

Kant said that several options are on the table to bring unanimity on how the issue could be resolved. Officials said the wording is likely to be decided in the run up to the leader's summit as ministers are currently taking a cue from what the heads of their governments had agreed up on in Bali, which has formed the basis for the text on Ukraine war in the two chair's summaries.

Kant and his team are drawing comfort from the willingness of all 20 member of the group to engage on all the issues, something the India sherpa said was not the case during Indonesia's presidency last year.

At the meeting, there was a detailed discussion around the global economic situation and the possible impact of the problems in the US and other developing markets on the developing economies as central banks led by the US Fed have raised interest rates to combat inflation, resulting in a flight of capital from emerging markets.

Kant said presentations on the marcro-economic situation highlighted how the pandemic has strained the fiscal situation in several parts of the world, increased fossil fuel consumption and increased the cost of living as food, fertiliser and fuel prices have soared. ""This will also require us to reshape the multilateral institutions,"" he said.",2023-04-01T20:46:00Z

Ramasubramanian of the Supreme Court, former judge Indira Banerjee and Justice S. Vaidyanathan of the Madras High Court.

TNSAF office-bearers N.L. Rajah, P.S. Raman, P. Wilson and P.H. Arvindh Pandian had spearheaded the collection drive after learning that the Cancer Institute required ₹1.37 crore for installing a solar power plant to meet the requirements of the Padma Vibhushan Dr. V. Shanta Block. The institute had decided to move towards the use of green energy as much as possible in response to climate change issues.

The designated senior advocates practising in the Madras High Court, pooled in their resources to install the solar power plant so that the money saved on electricity bills could be used to treat more cancer patients free of cost. The drive elicited a huge response and TNSAF ended up collecting much more than the target. It handed over the entire collection to the institute for the benefit of poor patients.

Cancer Institute Chairman R. Seshasayee and executive vice-chairman E. Hemanth Raj received the cheque in the presence of World Health Organisation's former Chief Scientist Sowmya Swaminathan who is now lending a helping hand to the research division of the institute.

The Governor explained that the theology ""created reckless exploitation of natural resources, conflict between humans and nature, and resulted in climate crisis"". The Darwinian Theory ""which insist on the survival of the fittest, meant those who are weak got no right to exist and only the strong prospered. It is the law of the jungle where there is no compassion, or sense of right or wrong"", the release quoted as saying.

On theory of Karl Marx, he said it raised perpetual conflicts between haves and have-nots. ""This model created divisions between and within different segments. It triggered perpetual conflict in society,"" he said.

The Rousseau's social contract theory, ""considered an individual as primary stakeholder and supports supremacy of the individual over collectives and state and society is a product. Like six blind men and an elephant, everyone looked at part of it, but nobody looked at it in totality.""

The Times of India,Carry Out Regular Inspections To Curb Illegal Mining In Aravalis: Ngt To State | Gurgaon News - Times of India,,"Gurgaon: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has asked the Haryana government to carry out regular inspections to find out if illegal mining is being carried out in Rithoj, which is part of the eco-sensitive Aravalis. It also asked for a quarterly review by the chief secretary. The NGT also sought an action-taken report in a month. It passed the order on January 5, when the green panel was hearing a petition by city resident HS Khatana, who alleged that rampant illegal mining in the area was having an effect on the groundwater, green cover and waterbodies.

The tribunal had earlier formed a 5-member committee to look into the allegation. The committee filed its report on January 5 and agreed that ""indiscriminate mining"" was being carried out.

""This site adjoins the Aravali hill range which makes an important wildlife habitat. The indiscriminate mining in this area is poised to cause irreversible damage to the natural ecosystem, wildlife habitat, enhance air pollution and add to global warming. Therefore, all concerned departments need to take timely and effective measures to enforce the applicable laws/rules in the interest of the environment and ecology of the region,"" the report said.

The report added that there were signs of fresh mining and transportation of sand in Rithoj. It also said that rules regarding felling of trees and restricting the digging depth to 9ft had been violated blatantly.

The report, however, pointed out that illegal mining was not the only cause for concern. ""Depletion of water table and damage to water bodies is not being caused by the mining activity per se, but subsequent land levelling or compacting may obliterate small body bodies and impoverish sub-surface moisture regime. Denudation may increase evaporation losses and enhanced absorption of solar heat. Removal of porous sand and increase in impervious surface may reduce infiltration and affect ground water table. At present, the old mining pits are serving as seasonal water conservation puddles.""

The tribunal, in its order, insisted on the fact that illegal mining was causing irreparable damage to the environment. ""We allow a further months' time to file an action taken report,"" the NGT bench of Justice Sudhir Agarwal and expert member A Senthil Vel said. The tribunal will take up the petition again on February 8.

Through the MoU, EPCH will collaborate with WII to establish the testing facility for its associated members involved in the Pashmina trade.

The facility will be based on a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model for assisting Pashmina traders in obtaining authenticity certificates for selling certified and genuine products. The MoU was signed in the presence of Bivash Ranjan, additional director general wildlife), ministry of environment, forest and climate change at WII.

All the tested products will be labelled with a traceable unique id tag with individual certificates, enabling a seamless trade of such products in national and international markets, as per WII officials.

In the absence of such a facility in the country, such products get under scrutiny to rule out the presence of prohibited fibres at the exit points of the country, which causes delays in clearance and associated demurrage charges and financial/business loss to the exporters and traders, as per sources.

""Often, our traders are stopped at customs checkpoints on suspicion that their Pashmina products may be carrying illegal Tibetan Antelope fibre. With the certification, such issues will cease,"" said SK Gupta, senior scientist of WII.

Speaking to TOI here recently, she said that the global humanitarian crisis displaces about 34,000 people each day due to natural hazards, climate change, armed conflict, epidemics, complex emergencies, etc. During times of crisis, people are found in camps, evacuation centres, or neighbouring communities. The effect of emergencies differs for different communities. In such a situation, protection mechanisms and service delivery break down. Sexual and reproductive health services are essential and will have to be continued as there is an increased risk of rape and other forms of sexual violence, early, child, and forced marriage, human trafficking, unintended pregnancy, unsafe abortion, complications during pregnancy and delivery, STI and HIV infection.

FPAI with a minimum initial service package (MISF) ensures that the cluster identifies an organisation to lead MISP implementation. This pre-preparedness for the minimum initial service package is through training FPAI staff, and collaboration with partner organisations and district-level disaster management committees. The initiated discussion on preparedness with MISP is to bring them together for collaborative work during response.

Stating that the S20 (Science 20) summit is emblematic of India's journey in forging a new path for advancement, IISc said with its intellectual heritage and current prowess in science and engineering, combined with a tradition of innovation with sustainability, India now has an opportunity to become a leader in disruptive science for development.

The G20 forum comprises 19 countries and the European Union. It consists of both industrialised and developing countries and its main focus has been the governance of the global economy. Over the years, however, G20 has been working towards addressing other related global challenges as well, such as climate change mitigation and sustainable development. Towards this end, it has set up several working groups, one of which is Science 20 or S20.

The S20's theme for 2023 will be 'disruptive science for innovative and sustainable development'. Within this broad theme, deliberations -- to be held in different parts of India (Agartala, Lakshadweep and Bhopal) -- will focus on three sets of issues.

The issues are: Universal holistic health, clean energy for a greener future, and connecting science to society and culture. The consultations will also include an inception meeting in Puducherry and a summit meeting in Coimbatore, IISc said.

Stating that the role of S20 in furthering the agenda of G20 was crucial, IISc said science will have to play a key role to achieve economic growth required to pull millions of people out of poverty while ensuring that development is inclusive and sustainable.

""But scientific advancements alone are not enough, it said, adding that meaningful development requires the cooperation of member nations so that experiences and breakthroughs in science and technology can be shared with each other. S20 is, therefore, an ideal platform to achieve this goal,"" IISc said.",2022-12-26T11:25:00Z
The Times of India,G-20's central aim should be 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' | India News - Times of India,,"India assumes the presidency of Group of Twenty (G20) amidst a daunting global environment riddled with policy challenges. A 'polycrisis' landscape confronts G20 with headwinds from slowing global growth and trade, high inflation, aggressive monetary policy tightening and associated spillovers, geopolitical tensions, debt distress, climate change and the lingering pandemic.

Amidst centrifugal forces pulling at the fabric of globalisation, the role of G20 in fostering global policy cooperation is crucial. As the third largest economy in the world in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms and the fifth largest in terms of market exchange rates, India accounts for 3.6% of G20 GDP in nominal terms and 8.2% in PPP terms.

The Hindu,The G-20 can be the UN Security Council alternative,,"As India begins its presidency of the G-20 (Group of Twenty), there is a certain reluctance on its part to take the bull by the horns and try to end the Russian invasion of Ukraine. India has gone out of its way to say that Ukraine will not be the centrepiece of the G-20 this year. This position is because of the fear of failure, especially because of the position India has taken not to condemn Russia; it is not because the Russian invasion is not the most urgent issue for the world to resolve. But after the G-20 summit in Bali, Indonesia, in November, there is greater understanding of the Indian position -- as articulated by U.S. President Joe Biden himself. Considering that the Bali declaration was virtually drafted by India, New Delhi has been recognised as a potential honest broker who may be able to end the devastating war.

The right place and the right time for India

The alphabetical rotation of the G-20 presidency has brought India to the right place at the right time, especially when the world is looking for an alternative to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), which has been paralysed by the veto. Most recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the UNSC's credibility hit rock bottom. Any reform of the UNSC, particularly the expansion of its permanent membership, will be strongly resisted by the permanent members and a large majority of the General Assembly because it does not benefit anyone except those who aspire to be permanent members.

Every candidate has a strong opponent waiting to pounce the moment there is any serious proposal to make the candidate country a permanent member. Among the proposals made in the last three decades, there is none that can command the votes of the five permanent members as well as two-thirds of the members of the General Assembly. Although the G-20, which consists of 19 countries and the European Union (EU), was set up by the G-7 countries in 1999, and upgraded to the level of Heads of State/Government in 2008 to address ""major issues related to the global economy, such as international financial stability, climate change mitigation and sustainable development"", its composition is such that it looks like it is an expanded Security Council. It is representative of all the significant countries of the 21st century and is balanced between developed and developing countries. The present permanent members and declared aspirants have been included while Africa and Latin America have also been represented. The EU represents a very important segment of the global power structure. A consensus decision of G-20 should be universally acceptable.

The platform of the Bali Declaration

A gradual transformation of the G-20 from an economic body to a political body can be initiated on the basis of the Bali Declaration, which constitutes the consensus in the group on the Russia-Ukraine war. If the G-20 emerges as peacemaker in Europe, it will attain legitimacy as a group to promote international peace and security; it can gradually become an alternative to the UNSC.

The most important difference will be that no one can prevent its meetings by use of the veto. Care should be taken not to isolate anyone and promote a solution, which is acceptable. Russia will have to reason out its behaviour rather than threaten the use of the veto to intimidate the international community. The grave danger of a permanent member waging a war and vetoing every resolution against it is a reality that the UN should address.

The first step for India to take is to highlight the Bali Declaration and to present a road map during the preparatory process for the G-20 and persuade the sherpas to take it on its agenda. The response cannot be negative except by Russia as it has to negotiate as an equal with the other members of the G-20. If Russia is looking for an escape route, even Russia will accept India's role as an honest broker in the process. This will enhance India's capacity to deal with the crisis in a formal way within the G-20. It will accomplish India's ultimate goal of securing the reform of the UNSC. Once the basic work is done, the UNSC can formalise the decision and implement it for international peace and security.

Not a new role

Being an honest broker in international peace and security is a role that is not new to India. Although it has taken strong positions on decolonisation and rights of the developing countries to play a role as a leader of the non-aligned world, it kept the conversation going among the protagonists and promoted a balanced outcome. India was the author of several landmark resolutions of the UNSC on the question of Palestine and administered the healing touch whenever confrontation developed in multilateral fora. India was a part of efforts made to prevent the expulsion of Egypt from the Non-Aligned Movement at the Havana summit when the Arabs turned against Egypt.

Flexibility in negotiations even while being principled in its national position gave India a role in many situations. As the President of the G-20, the fund of goodwill that India has earned in the UN will be an asset at this critical moment.

The legitimisation of the G-20 as a global arbiter in international affairs will create a multilateral instrument where all members are equal. Though it may take a very long time for it to replace the UNSC, a beginning will have been made in making the UN an effective instrument in stopping wars and building cooperation. Such an opportunity comes, but rarely in history. It will be worth the effort even if it only plants the seeds for the beginning of a new UNSC.

The Times of India,"At G20, SDG, food security top emerging market agenda | India News - Times of India",,"UDAIPUR: Emerging market economies -- from China to Argentina and Russia to South Africa -- called upon the G20 to focus on accelerating Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and addressing issues related to food and energy security, with some of them complimenting India for the role played in evolving a consensus in Bali.

At a late evening meeting of the emerging markets group on sidelines of the G20 meeting, Indonesia, which was the host, complimented India for helping evolve a consensus at the recent leaders' summit in Bali. Russia praised the emerging market group for working together, sources familiar with the deliberations at the late evening discussions told TOI.

Indonesia insisted that achieving sustainable development goals by 2030, an issue that is crucial to the Global South, should not be confined only to the development working group and should be at the fore of the discussions.

Mexico said that the voice of the developing countries would be heard on some of the issues confronting them.

""Solidarity among this group is not to divide the G20. We should agree to put development issues such as energy and food at the core,"" a source said quoting the Chinese delegation. China is also said to have highlighted issued around supply chain and climate change and called for protecting the common interest of the emerging economies, sources said.

Following the Ukraine-Russia conflict, soaring food and energy prices have emerged as a major concern for developing and poor countries, putting them in the spotlight as economies to shield themselves from scarcity.

Mexico is said to have highlighted the challenges of high inflation and recession facing economies around the globe with its Sherpa highlighting the food and fuel challenges faced countries in Latin American and Africa, a source familiar with the discussions told TOI.

Turkey, while calling for the group of 12 emerging countries to work together, also suggested that issues linked to migration and displacement should be part of main agenda.

South Africa added fertilisers to this and said that there as aneed to diversify fertiliser production. The issue has again come up in the backdrop of the Russia-Ukraine war, which has resulted in a sharp spike in fertiliser prices, putting at risk farmers across the world. The South African Sherpa s also learnt to have demanded support for extending the patents waiver plan at WTO beyond medicines to therapeutics, a move seen to be crucial to benefit those combating Covid and other health emergencies in poor and developing countries.

The G20 platform is in a unique position to provide leadership and financial resources and work together to bring the world back on track to achieve the sustainable development goals (SDG), which have taken a knock due to the pandemic.

Participants at a panel discussion here spoke about India's response to the pandemic .

India has been at the forefront of adopting, implementing, and monitoring the SDGs and localising it to suit the subnational and local realities. While there is a long way to go, many of India's programmatic interventions have been successful in creating impact at scale. India's innovative approaches, tools and experiences in areas such as digital transformation especially 'data for development', just green transition, women-led development, and economic growth for SDGs offer a variety of good practices and lessons learned, from which other nations can benefit to address their own challenges to SDG acceleration.",2022-12-04T20:26:00Z

This will also support India's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under climate change commitments to achieve an additional carbon sink of 2.5-3.0 billion tonnes.

""The government of India is a signatory to the Bonn Challenge by pledging to restore 13 MHA of degraded land by 2020 and 21 MHA by 2030 in India. Maharashtra is among the five states to implement the project, other states being Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, and Nagaland,"" said Tembhurnikar.

The PCCF added, ""In the last decade, Maharashtra has restored 1.83 MHA and stands third in the country after MP and Odisha in forest land restoration. FLR is not just tree plantation but involves integration of entire landscape by taking up a gamut of activities like grassland development, checking soil erosion, natural regeneration, surface water restoration among a host of other things.""

A three-day workshop will begin at Chandrapur Forest Academy on Wednesday to deliberate on how to implement the project.

Heat waves cost poor countries the most, exacerbating inequality

Heat waves, intensified by climate change, have cost the global economy trillions of dollars in the last 30 years, a study published Friday found, with poor countries paying the steepest price. And those lopsided economic effects contribute to widening inequalities around the world, according to the research. The reason for that disparity is simple: poor countries are often situated closer to the tropics, where temperatures are warmer anyway. During heat waves, they become even hotter. The study comes just days ahead of the start of the COP27 climate summit in Egypt, where the question of compensation for countries which are disproportionately vulnerable to but least responsible for climate change is expected to be one of the key topics.

Hindustan Times,India's energy demand could rise over 3% annually until 2030: IEA,,"India's energy demand could rise over 3% annually -- the largest for any country -- until 2030 due to urbanisation and industrialisation, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its World Energy Outlook released on Thursday.

IEA, which warned the world is in the midst of a global energy crisis, said India continues to make great strides with renewables deployment and efficiency policies. But the sheer scale of India's development means that the combined import bill for fossil fuels doubles over the next two decades with oil by far the largest component. ""This points to continued risks to energy security,"" the analysis said.

Coal generation is projected to continue to expand but its share in electricity generation is projected to fall from just below 75% to 55% over this period. Government programmes such as the Self-Reliant India scheme and strong economics underpin robust growth in renewables and electric mobility, notably for two to three-wheelers.

Renewables meet over 60% of India's growth in demand for power. They account for 35% of the electricity mix by 2030. Solar PV alone accounts for over 15%, the analysis said. It added coal will still meet a third of overall energy demand growth by 2030 for India.

The analysis said high gas and coal prices because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine have stoked inflationary pressures and created a looming risk of recession as well as a $2 trillion windfall for fossil fuel producers above their 2021 net income. IEA has projected the peaking of global fossil fuel use and said the ongoing energy crisis could lead to a turning point in the global energy mix.

The share of fossil fuels in the mix has been at around 80% for decades. By 2030, this share could fall below 75%, and to just above 60% by 2050, the analysis said.

Full achievement of all climate pledges would move the world towards safer ground. But there will still be a large gap between today's climate mitigation goals and preventing a 1.5-degree rise in global temperatures over pre-industrial levels.

The analysis shows a faster decline in emissions compared to the World Energy Outlook 2021, reflecting the additional pledges that have been made earlier this year by India and Indonesia.

""If implemented on time and in full, these additional national commitments - as well as sectoral commitments for specific industries and company targets (considered for the first time in this year's APS) - keep the temperature rise at around 1.7 degree C,"" the analysis said.

India's updated nationally determined contributions (NDC) were submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in August.

The NDC seeks to reduce the emissions intensity of its GDP by 45% by 2030, from the 2005 level, and to achieve about 50% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030.

The second goal will be implemented with the help of the transfer of technology and low-cost international finance including from the Green Climate Fund (GCF). The NDC said this update will help achieve a long-term goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2070.

The analysis said alongside short-term measures to try to shield consumers from the impacts of the crisis, many governments are now taking longer-term steps. ""Some are seeking to increase or diversify oil and gas supplies, and many are looking to accelerate structural changes. The most notable responses include the US Inflation Reduction Act, the EU's Fit for 55 package and REPowerEU, Japan's Green Transformation (GX) programme, Korea's aim to increase the share of nuclear and renewables in its energy mix, and ambitious clean energy targets in China and India.""

India has made progress towards its domestic renewable energy capacity goal of 500 gigawatts (GW) in 2030, and renewables meet nearly two‐thirds of the country's rapidly rising demand for electricity presently.

Based on the latest policies worldwide, new measures help propel global clean energy investment to more than $2 trillion a year by 2030, a rise of more than 50% from today.

In a statement, IEA said as markets rebalance in this scenario, the upside for coal from today's crisis is temporary as renewables, supported by nuclear power, see sustained gains. ""As a result, a high point for global emissions is reached in 2025. At the same time, international energy markets undergo a profound reorientation in the 2020s as countries adjust to the rupture of Russia-Europe flows.""

IEA executive director Fatih Birol said energy markets and policies have changed as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, not just for the time being, but for decades to come. ""Even with today's policy settings, the energy world is shifting dramatically before our eyes. Government responses around the world promise to make this a historic and definitive turning point towards a cleaner, more affordable, and more secure energy system.""",2022-10-27T06:17:00Z
The Times of India, Cholera making a comeback after years of decline: WHO | India News - Times of India,,"NEW DELHI: The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that cholera, a disease of the 19th century, may be making a comeback again after years of decline.

According to Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of WHO, a worrying upsurge in cases of the food and water borne disease has been observed around the globe over the past year.

""Cholera thrives on poverty and conflict, but is now being turbo-charged by climate change. Extreme climate events like floods, cyclones and droughts further reduce access to clean water and create the ideal environment for cholera to spread,"" Ghebreyesus said.

Cholera is an acute diarrhoeal infection caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio Cholerae. It causes acute watery diarrhoea. While most people recover from the disease with mild or no symptoms, some can develop acute watery diarrhoea with severe dehydration.

According to Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, the group medical director of Max healthcare group, if left untreated, severe dehydration can lead to serious complications and even cause death.

""Cholera was never eliminated in India. But, it's true the number of cases of the disease have gone up. Even in a city like Delhi we have seen clustering of cases of cholera in July-August. Some patients also require hospitalisation,"" he said.

Seven people died of cholera and about 100 others were affected by the food and water-borne disease in Odisha's Rayagada district.

According to a study published in the International Journal of Environment Research and Public Health (IJERP), cholera outbreaks are relatively frequent in India. From 1997 to 2006, the study says, 68 outbreaks were reported, while the reported outbreaks rose to 559 between 2009 and 2017.

""However, this is only the tip of the iceberg. The disease is grossly underreported in India, and despite these figures, cholera remains an under-recognised health issue in India,"" the researchers from Okayama University, Japan and Brainware University, Kolkata have said in the IJERP study.

Hindustan Times,BMC to begin work on citizen facilities,,"Mumbai: A day after the Supreme Court (SC) gave its nod to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to continue construction of recreational facilities and citizen services along the coastal Road, the civic body on Saturday said construction of halted work for the project will begin.

An official from the coastal roads project told HT that these facilities will take two years to complete.

""Since we did not have permissions from SC till now, we only awarded tenders for the coastal road,"" said the official. ""The current deadline of November 2023 does not include the citizen facilities. Currently, we have put out a conceptual plan and floated for suggestions from general citizens and renowned architects.""

They will float a tender once the plan is finalised, it added. This landscaping project will require a minimum of 2 years to complete but the intention is to finish it simultaneously along the coastal road.

The apex court on Friday allowed the civic body to build butterfly parks and gardens along the coastal road saying development cannot be stopped in the name of climate change and sustainable development.

In December 2019, the SC barred BMC from constructing these facilities and upheld the same order in October 2020. On July 8, BMC once again sought permission from SC to begin the construction of citizen facilities along the coastal roads.

Shedding light on the work that will be undertaken following SC's go-ahead, a press statement signed by MM Swami, chief engineer of the coastal road project, states that 25%-30% of the reclaimed area will be used for the coastal road, while the remaining 70%-75% area will be used for building recreational activities & citizen facilities which will include toilets, jogging track, cycle track, butterfly park, marine walkway, open theatre, children's parks and playgrounds, police post, bus stops, underground footpath to cross the road, jetty etc.

The civic body listed some of the important facilities that will be created along the coastal road. Just like the promenade at Marine Drive and Worli, BMC will build a 7.5km long 'Seaside Promenade' between Priyadarshini Park in Malabar Hill to Bandra Worli Sea Link in Worli along the coastal road which will be the largest seaside walkway in Mumbai.

Additionally, three large underground parking facilities are proposed to be constructed along the coastal road with a capacity to park 1856 vehicles. BMC has planned to build these parking lots near the tourists' spots.",2022-10-03T21:09:00Z
The Hindu,Chamber of commerce to come up with report on recent power tariff revision ,,"The Madras Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCI) on Friday said it would come up with recommendations on the recent power tariff revision announced by the State government.

Chamber president T.R. Kesavan said: ""MCCI had given a recommendation earlier. We are going to re-work on it now. So unless we give a solution to reduce the cost of the system and find out an alternative, they don't have a choice. So, our report will look at how to optimise and do better so that it helps the government and the consumer.""

Mr. Kesavan pointed out that there was a revenue problem for the government, ""but we need to come out with an alternative solution.""

For the coming year, the chamber has picked up some key areas which it would focus on such as Industry 4.0, electric vehicles, fintech, climate change and sustainability, education and skilling, arbitration and encouraging start-ups.

For the skilling part, the chamber recently signed an MoU with Tamil Nadu Skill Development Corporation under the ""Naan Mudalvan Scheme"".

""This is one area that we will be concentrating on. Apart from skilling, upskilling and reskilling will be a focus area. The chamber has 12 expert committees and we will use our resources for skilling the youths,"" Mr. Kesavan said.

MCCI is working on bringing out a ready reckoner or a handbook for regulatory compliances titled Doing Business in Tamil Nadu by working closely with the government to encourage new investments and maintain a business-friendly climate.

Mr. Kesavan said that Tamil Nadu, in spite of the setback due to the pandemic, was able to recover faster than many other States due to its resilient and robust public health system and concerted efforts. He noted that Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) of Tamil Nadu bounced back to 14.6% in the financial year 2021-22 and is expected to grow by 14% in the financial year in 2022-23 going by the data.

""The State government has undertaken various initiatives such as allocation of ₹100 crore to improve the infrastructure of export companies, setting up of knowledge city and releasing export promotion strategy to make Tamil Nadu a leader among Indian States in exports,"" he said.",2022-09-16T16:48:00Z
The Times of India,Conservation Of Biodiversity: 3-day Survey Under Way | Gurgaon News - Times of India,,"Gurgaon: The Haryana State Biodiversity Board (HSBB) along with the forest department and Indira Gandhi University, Rewari, is carrying out a three-day survey of the forest area in Rewari. The aim is to gather data on shrubs, grass and trees in the district. It also aims to analyse the data on butterflies and insects to understand the forest diversity.

Rewari was selected for the survey because it has Mangar Bani-like forest. The survey is being conducted in Khol, Bawana Gujjar and Rajgarh areas of Rewari district. More than 2,500 hectares of land will be covered in the survey. The outcome of the survey will help in chalking out management strategy for the conservation of biodiversity.

Khol comprises 10 villages having contiguous stretches of Aravalis such as Palra, Ahhrod, Bassduda, Khol, Manethi, Bhalki, Majra, Nandha, Balwari and Khaleta, covering an area of about 1,000 hectares. The survey will also form the basis for observing the impact of habitat disturbance and climate change on the ecology of the region.

""We have already completed surveys in Khol and Bawana Gujjar area and covered 7 kilometres. We aim to cover around 5 kilometres on Monday. We have samples of plant species and photographic documents of butterflies, beetles and other small insects. This is a study of the entire biodiversity. We are also conducting awareness camps with the locals about biodiversity conservation and people's biodiversity register,"" said Amrender Singh Rao, regional coordinator in Gurgaon, HSBB.

The field survey so far included sample collection strategies by using different wildlife census methods and different ways to document and identify local biodiversity. In this regard around 80 plant species of medicinal importance were identified and collected by the students for herbarium preparation with the help of experts.

""The survey aims to create awareness about the medicinal plants that are locally available and document the traditional knowledge. We will identify the existing threats or pressures to biodiversity and ecosystem,"" said Rao.",2022-09-12T03:17:00Z
The Times of India,Rajasthan to launch coding classes in schools from next session | Jaipur News - Times of India,,"JAIPUR: Students of senior secondary classes (11-12) in government schools will study the basics of coding, programming and artificial intelligence (AI) from the next session.

The state education department is among the first few in the country to have completed the School Curriculum Framework (SCF) as mandated under the New Education Policy (NEP). The department has identified 25 areas of importance as part of the curriculum, making 50 hours of teachers' training compulsory every year.

""The new curriculum has laid great emphasis on developing the scientific temperament of students in schools. The syllabus will have modules on coding and programming along with sessions on AI to produce world-class tech grads from our schools,"" said Kamlendra Singh Ranawat, spokesperson of Rajasthan State Council of Educational Research & Training (RSCERT), Udaipur.

The previous SCF came up almost two decades have become redundant when it comes to subjects like environment, health, and technology. The evolving issues like climate change, the rapid pace of urbanization, and disrupting harmony between humans and the animal-plant kingdom will be part of the syllabus. ""The revised curriculum has given impetus to issues which were remotely touched in the previous SCF. The whole idea is creating mass awareness on the subject in order to prepare the present generation to take on the challenges which will impact the world for the coming next centuries,"" said Ranawat.

The concepts of health will move from treatment to prevention of diseases in the textbooks. Students will be taught the preventive ways to minimise the impact of diseases which are impacting the human resource of the country.

The most important aspect of the curriculum is to focus on integrating education and technology to make education more scientific and easier to comprehend. ""The curriculum is focussed on effective teaching by integrating technology with pedagogy, identifying and properly utilizing various ICT tools to be used in teaching learning and assessment,"" said Priyanka Jodhawat, director of RSCERT. The training of teachers in technology and academics to become a regular feature of the academic calendar enabling the teachers to provide updated learning experiences to students.

Hindustan Times,"Somaiya visits Dapoli, seeks action against Anil Parab's resort; officials assure action",,"Mumbai: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former MP Kirit Somaiya visited local authorities in Dapoli seeking action against Sai Resorts, reportedly controlled by Shiv Sena leader Anil Parab, and local authorities assured the BJP leader they wwill expedite the process of demolishing the structure at the earliest.

The visit follows orders by the pollution control bodies of the Central and state governments which directed action against illegal construction at the site of the resort.

A letter dated August 25, the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) stated: ""We have received a letter along with a report of the joint committee constituted by ministry of environment and forest and climate change (MoEF&CC) in the matter. The DCZMC is empowered to take action against the unauthorised construction carried out in the CRZ area. The action taken report in this regards shall be submitted forthwith. This has been issued with approval for the competent authority.""

Anil Parab did not respond to calls. After the Enforcement Directorate raids at the premises on May 26, the Sena leader had tweeted: ""The predicated offence that was cited was that they allege that Sai Resort in Dapoli, that has not even started operations, released its sewerage water it released into the sea... I've been saying from the 1st day that I've no connection with the resort & its owner is Sadanand Kadam (sic).""

Somaiya on Saturday also visited the spot where Milind Navekar's farm house once stood. The farmhouse of the Sena leader was also demolished.

The Times of India,Move to forecast air pollution 3 days in advance in Bihar | Patna News - Times of India,,"PATNA: The Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) would soon start air quality forecasting up to three days in advance with the assistance from the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), said its chairman Ashok Kumar Ghosh.

Speaking at the four-day India Clean Air Summit 2022 organized by the Centre for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP) at Bengaluru on Friday, Ghosh also announced that at least one air quality monitoring station would be set up in each district of Bihar by the year 2023.

He said the BSPCB has already installed 35 air quality monitoring stations in 22 districts to have a proper assessment of the air quality of the district. Now, such stations would also be set up in all the remaining districts soon. And, with the recent initiative of the BSPCB and IMD, forecasting of air quality would also be made with a view to informing the pollution level of the region to citizens in advance.

Ghosh further pointed out that Patna, Gaya, and Muzaffarpur are the three non-attainment cities in Bihar whose air quality did not match the national ambient air quality requirements from 2011 to 2015. The National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), announced by the union ministry of environment, forest and climate change in January 2019, has led to the development of clean air action plans with an aim to reduce PM2.5 pollution by 20-30% by 2024 as compared to 2017.

He observed that there are three non-attainment cities in the state based on the current air pollution scenario with 42% of air pollution coming from outside the state. Now the state may have at least 20 non-attainment cities soon, he said.

Air pollution experts and researchers strongly believe that a state like Bihar with the highest number of non-attainment cities in the country can play a role model for other states by taking proactive steps.

Head of the Centre for Air Pollution Studies at CSTEP, Pratima Singh, said setting up a robust monitoring infrastructure across urban centres in the state will help build better plans for cities which face air pollution problems but have yet not been identified as non-attainment cities. Using alternative methods like low-cost sensors will only help better strengthen the monitoring infrastructure, she said.

IIT-Kanpur civil engineering professor S N Triapthi said an estimated one million green jobs are available within the air quality domain across India. Necessary training must be imparted to the youths at the IITs so that they get the jobs, he added.",2022-08-27T03:56:00Z
Hindustan Times,India adds 10 more Ramsar sites,,"India has added 10 more names to the Ramsar list -- that designates wetlands of international importance -- taking the total number of such sites in the country to 64, a statement by the Union environment ministry said on Wednesday.

India has added 10 more names to the Ramsar list -- that designates wetlands of international importance -- taking the total number of such sites in the country to 64, a statement by the Union environment ministry said on Wednesday.

According to the statement, the 10 new sites include 6 wetlands from Tamil Nadu and one each from Goa, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha.

""Absolutely thrilled to inform that 10 more Indian wetlands have got Ramsar recognition as wetlands of international importance. This takes India's tally of Ramsar sites to 64. Special congratulations to Odisha, Goa, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh,"" tweeted Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav on Wednesday.

Under the convention on wetlands, an intergovernmental treaty, contracting parties are expected to identify and place suitable sites on the 'List of Wetlands of International Importance', also known as the Ramsar List.

So far, 64 wetlands covering an area of 1,250,361 hectares have been designated as Ramsar Sites of International Importance from India. The 10 sites designated recently include the Koonthankulam Bird Sanctuary which is a man-made wetland in Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu. It is the largest reserve for breeding resident and migratory water birds in South India and an 'Important Bird and Biodiversity Area' forming part of the Central Asian Flyway, a brief by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) states. The wetland also irrigates about 190 acres of paddy.

Nanda Lake in Goa, another addition to the list, has freshwater marshes that lie adjacent to one of the major rivulets of the Zuari river, said the brief. This enables local residents to store water during the off-monsoon season. The stored water is also utilised to cultivate paddy downstream of the lake and supports fishing and recreation, it said.

According to the brief, the lake is a habitat for Black-headed ibis, Common kingfisher, Wire-tailed swallow, Bronze-winged jacana, Brahminy kite, among others.

Satkosia gorge, which is also on the list, is spread along the Mahanadi in Odisha. Established in 1976 as a wildlife sanctuary, Satkosia is the meeting point of two biogeographic regions of India; the Deccan Peninsula and the Eastern Ghats, contributing immense biodiversity, according to ministry's brief.

Satkosia gorge wetland is a mosaic of marshes and evergreen forests. The forests of these catchments play a vital role in the prevention of the gorge siltation. They also help in maintaining a desirable depth of water crucial for the endangered gharial population, the brief added.

Among the seven other sites on the list, Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve (GoMBR) is one of the most important located on the southeastern coastline. The Reserve is home to several globally important and highly threatened species like the Dugong, Whale Shark, Seahorses, Balanoglossus, Green sea turtle, Hawksbill Turtle, Dolphins, Sacred chanks etc.

""The ten new sites are some of India's most picturesque sites. Many of them are also Important Bird Areas, significant for the migratory birds on the Central Asian Flyway, getting more than 20,000 birds each year. This is a good opportunity for the state to decide what kind of expansion we want to have in our Ramsar sites. There is a proposed pharmaceutical expansion inside Vedanthangal bird sanctuary, which is India's oldest bird sanctuary. There is a proposal to expand pharma production inside the wetland, which is chemical-intensive and does not help the wetland as a habitat. We need to rethink. With so many new Ramsar sites, India should draw up a fresh approach for wetlands. Sites with global importance should support artisanal livelihoods and activities which sustain the ecosystem, not hinder it,"" said Neha Sinha, wildlife biologist and author

The Convention has several mechanisms to guide parties designate their most significant wetlands as Ramsar Sites, and to take the steps necessary to manage them effectively by maintaining their ecological character. ""Ramsar Sites are designated because they meet the Criteria for identifying Wetlands of International Importance. The first criterion refers to Sites containing representative, rare or unique wetland types, and the other eight cover Sites of international importance for conserving biological diversity. These criteria emphasize the importance the Convention places on sustaining biodiversity,"" the Ramsar convention website states.

Last week, India had added 5 wetlands to the list -- Karikili Bird Sanctuary, Pallikaranai Marsh Reserve Forest and Pichavaram Mangrove in Tamil Nadu; Pala wetland in Mizoram and Sakhya Sagar in Madhya Pradesh.",2022-08-03T19:22:00Z

Activist and advocate Godfrey Pimenta said the decision was timely and welcome. Calling it sensible, Hussain Indorewalla, assistant professor, Kamla Raheja Architecture College, said, ""By retaining the NDZ category, the chief minister seems to have scrapped Regulation 33(8) of the DCPR."" He said the next step should be to ensure that habitats of the poor and the NDZ ecosystem service are protected in the Development Plan. The preparation of DP-2034 began around 2014-15. The draft was revised after major errors were found in existing land use.

Thereafter, the BMC invited objections/suggestions, a hearing was conducted by the planning committee and the draft DP, along with the recommendations of the committee, was placed before the BMC's general body, which in turn made certain suggestions and changes. These were then passed and the draft DP-2034 was forwarded to the state government for its approval (the state government is the final authority on the sanctioning of the DP; a major portion of DP-2034 was sanctioned by it in May 2018).

Hindustan Times,Only drastic steps will soften the climate blow,,"Delhi is known for its brutal summers. We take pride in our ability to endure heat that would stun most others into a traumatised coma. We toss the daily maximum recorded temperatures around and feel like heroes to have lived through another day that's off the charts. We rejoice in the blaze of the sun, the flowering amaltas and gulmohar reflecting our unquenchable spirit to survive and flourish. Bring it on, we say.

But now, the summers are different. Instead of a season's discomfort to be bravely borne before the monsoons deliver us into cool wetness, we are now confronting a prolonged and uncertain disaster, one that is changing life and death as we have known them in this city.

We tend to obsess about maximum temperatures and, indeed, they do matter immensely for people who labour outdoors during the day. Construction workers, rickshaw pullers, street vendors, delivery agents are among the millions of people whose working conditions can cause heatstroke, a potentially fatal condition. Less discussed, but equally worrying, is the rise in humidity. Thanks to years of watering our much-vaunted greenery, Delhi's air now carries more moisture than its surrounding landscape. Higher humidity lowers the body's ability to cool itself by sweating. No fans or coolers can enable the sweat to evaporate if the air already holds enough moisture.

The other big change in Delhi's summers is that the minimum temperatures are also rising. Hot days can be tolerated if one can cool down at night. But warm nights, made worse by whining mosquitoes that thrive in the humidity, result in disturbed sleep. We rise to another unrelenting day of heat, our bodies and minds still tired and unrestored.

Taken together, longer periods of hotter days and nights with higher humidity make Delhi's summer much harder to bear. Everyone reading this is likely to say, ""Thank god for the AC (air conditioner)"". Yes, air conditioning is a lifesaver for those who can afford it. Yet the costs that it imposes on everyone else, and on the environment, are high, and make the city and the countryside hotter still.

One, ACs throw out waste heat, making life instantly worse for everyone around who is not inside an airconditioned cocoon. Think of all those people on two-wheelers stuck in traffic, forced to inhale heat as well as toxic gases from your air conditioned car's tailpipe. Those who don't have access to the personalised armour of climate-controlled air -- that means the vast majority of Delhi's citizens -- suffer more from this urban heat island effect. Two, ACs need a lot of power to run, which means that somewhere else, there's more coal being mined and burnt, more dams being built, more people displaced and dispossessed, and more air and water poisoned.

Three, burning fossil fuels such as coal contributes to global warming, making future summers even worse for us, our children and other living beings. Four, and this is their insidious psychological effect, ACs make the planet hotter for us by shifting our sense of thermal comfort. Once one is used to spending time in an airconditioned environment, everything else -- even temperatures that we tolerated before -- feels unbearable. ACs reset our body's thermostats; we rely on them more and more. Feeling hot? Crank up the AC! Our itchy trigger fingers on those remote buttons are adding to the crisis.

Exactly who will pay the price for the well-off staying cool is clear: In July 1995 in Chicago, unprecedented heat meant that affluent people ran their ACs longer, drawing so much electricity that there were power cuts in poorer neighbourhoods. The worst hit were elderly African-Americans, frail and socially isolated, living alone in stuffy apartments. It was their bodies that piled up in morgues. Marginalised older people were also the worst-hit by the 2003 European heatwave that killed more than 70,000 people. In Delhi, we can expect that harm will come predominantly not only to the elderly and infants, but also to all those who toil outdoors, pushing their malnourished bodies to the brink to earn a living. And to those who live in unventilated, cramped shacks with tin roofs, without regular water or power. And to those who are most exposed to dengue, malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases and least able to afford health care.

What can we do to make the social geography of the climate crisis impacts more just? How do we protect everyone from global warming, especially those who are most vulnerable? The National Disaster Management Agency's web page on heatwaves shows how absurdly ill-prepared we are. Some Indian cities such as Ahmedabad have action plans, but they too are alarmingly inadequate. Issuing colour-coded alerts, distributing packets of oral rehydration solutions, and closing schools and offices are nowhere near enough. We need drastic measures. In the worst heatwaves, how about rationing air-conditioning for private users? How about giving poorer people emergency access to public air-conditioned spaces: Metro stations and malls for sleeping at night? For a more lasting effect, we need to make our workplaces, homes and transport more sustainable by reviving the passive cooling technologies we developed over hundreds of years. We can't reverse the climate crisis. But we can stop it from growing far worse.",2022-05-27T17:01:00Z
The Times of India,Young Minds Debate Climate Impact At Rbi Meet | Ranchi News - Times of India,,"Ranchi: Reserve Bank Of India (RBI) Ranchi organised an inter-college debate competition on the topic, 'Factoring climate risk in institutional finance will impede growth in developing country like India', to create awareness among the students about the RBI's role in financial growth and provide a platform to them to express their opinion about institutional finance.

Five students spoke for the motion while another five against the motion during the debate.

Participants supporting the motion were of the view that for a developing country like India, factoring climate risks in institutional finance will only create hurdles and it will effect growth. On the other hand, participants opposing the motion highlighted risks to life, ecosystems, and economies that have arisen due to climate change.

Taking to TOI, Robin Sethi, a post-graduate student of finance from a city-based B-School speaking for the motion said, ""The rapid growth in fossil fuel consumption definitely triggers the concern of CO2 emissions. But in India's perspective, emission per person is still minimum in comparison to the world. An average Indian household consumes 1/10th electricity as that of an average household in the United States.""

Adding further Sethi said he was not aligned with climate policies, ""but we must keep in mind that India has over 80 million people living below poverty line and that is something which needs to be addressed first. Factoring climate risk is inevitable but not at the cost of future whose village recently got electrified and not at all at the cost of opportunities, affordability, and growth of our own citizens.""

Lekisha, another participating supporting the topic, said, ""The interest on loans will be very high and small businesses will shut down as they wouldn't have investment and enough resources to comply with the climate factors. Apart from that even if small businesses try to cover the costs through insurance, the premium rates will be so high that they wouldn't survive.""

Hindustan Times,Marine heat waves over Indian Ocean are reducing monsoon rain over central India,,"NEW DELHI: The rise in marine heat waves (periods of extremely high temperatures in the ocean) over the Indian Ocean is leading to reduction in monsoon rainfall over Central India but an enhancement of monsoon rain over the South Peninsular region, according to a new paper.

The research paper by the Centre for Climate Change Research at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology was published in the Journal of Geographical Research -- Oceans on Tuesday.

The western Indian Ocean region experienced the largest increase in marine heatwaves (MHW) at a rate of about 1.5 events per decade, followed by the north Bay of Bengal at a rate of 0.5 events per decade during 1982-2018, the paper said adding that the western Indian Ocean had 66 MHW events while the Bay of Bengal had 94 MHW events during the 36-year period.

Of the 66 events over the western Indian Ocean, 21 were during monsoon months (June to September) while 34 of the 94 MHW events over Bay of Bengal.

""The marine heatwaves in the western Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal are found to result in drying conditions over the central Indian subcontinent. At the same time, there is a significant increase in the rainfall over south peninsular India in response to the heatwaves in the north Bay of Bengal. These changes are in response to the modulation of the monsoon winds by the heatwaves. This is the first time that a study has demonstrated a close link between marine heatwaves and atmospheric circulation and rainfall,"" a statement released by authors of the research paper said on Tuesday.

Climate model projections suggest further warming of the Indian Ocean in the future, which will very likely intensify the MHWs and their impact on the monsoon rainfall. Since the frequency, intensity, and area of MHWs are increasing, it is essential that we closely monitor and forecast these events in advance in order to mitigate their impacts, the paper has concluded.

Marine heatwaves are periods of extremely high temperatures in the ocean--above the 90th percentile. These events cause habitat destruction due to coral bleaching, seagrass destruction, and loss of kelp forests, affecting the fisheries sector, the authors said.

An underwater survey showed that 85% of the corals in Gulf of Mannar near the Tamil Nadu coast got bleached after the marine heatwave in May 2020. Though recent studies have reported their occurrence and impacts in the global oceans, they are least understood in the tropical Indian Ocean, the authors said in a statement.

These marine heatwaves occur due to background ocean warming in the Indian Ocean and also in response to El Niño events in the Pacific Ocean. Locally, a peak in solar radiation and a dip in evaporative cooling due to weak winds lead to the formation of these marine heatwaves. In the western Indian Ocean, the weak winds also reduce the heat transported by ocean currents from the near-equatorial regions toward the north, intensifying the marine heatwave.

In the southeast Indian Ocean, coral bleaching events due to the MHWs were reported, mostly associated with the El Niño and Madden-Julian Oscillations (MJO) events and exacerbated due to climate crisis. Studies have also reported high sea surface temperatures in the western Indian Ocean (Seychelles region), Arabian Sea, and the Bay of Bengal region (Andaman Sea) and also point out the coral bleaching events due to intense warming in these regions.

The IITM team used international datasets for sea surface temperatures and monsoon rainfall data from IMD for the analysis.

""Rapid Ocean warming due to climate change is the key factor leading to the rise in marine heatwaves. As global emissions continue unabated, we might see permanent marine heatwave conditions in the Indian Ocean that will have severe impacts on the fisheries and extreme weather events over South Asia. We need urgent measures to monitor and forecast these events and their impacts,"" said Roxy Mathew Koll, climate scientist at IIITM and co-author of the paper.

""This is a very important study. Marine heat waves are a new research topic. I am happy to see the IITM group has come out with this study. Heat waves over land regions are studied very well but marine heat waves are not well explored. Marine heat waves will also have a major impact on marine ecosystems and biodiversity which we should study separately,"" said M Rajeevan, former secretary, ministry of earth sciences.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in their 'The Physical Science Basis' report released last August, said that the surface Indian Ocean has warmed faster than the global average. Marine heatwaves have become more frequent over the 20th century globally and are also projected to increase around the globe over the 21st century.

Ocean warming is likely to further decrease ocean oxygen concentrations, and this deoxygenation is projected to persist for thousands of years. Global mean sea level will continue to rise over the 21st century in response to continued warming of the climate system, the report said.",2022-02-01T17:36:00Z

The enforcement team conducted raids on Fraser Road, Exhibition Road and Station Road and seized 18-20kg of polythene and plastic materials from shops and collected a fine of Rs11,000 from them.

Arvind Kumar, city manager of the municipal body, said only one team from the headquarter was assigned for the enforcement of plastic ban due to other engagements. ""The team raided the shops in areas like Exhibition Road, Dak Bungalow, Exhibition Road and Station Road. From Thursday, each team will carry out the drive in Azimabad, Bankipore, Kankarbagh, New Capital, Patliputra and Patna City circles. Fine will be imposed as per the number of thermocol-made products and polythene seized from the shops,"" he told this newspaper on Wednesday.

He added: ""We had earlier conducted awareness drive, so that the shops get enough time to clear their stock. A separate team has been formed in every circle for anti-polythene drive.""

The senior officials of state forest, environment and climate change department had already asked the manufacturers, dealers and traders to clear their stocks comprising plastic materials before the December 15 deadline. The ban also covers disposable plastic cups, throwaway cutleries and covers of packed foodstuff.

Kanchan Kumari, city manager (Patliputra circle), said the drive for plastic ban will be carried out from Thursday onwards at Ashiana Colony, Digha, Rajeev Nagar and Patliputra (New and Old). ""A team of five officials will lead this drive effectively. We have earlier conducted the drive against single-use plastic. This time, we are focusing on thermocol products, especially shops selling decorative items and cutleries for events,"" she said.

Meanwhile, members of the Confederation of Indian Traders (CAIT) and Bihar Plastic Industries Association (BPIA) have expressed their concern over the ban on plastic and thermocol products.

Kamal Nopany, state chairman of CAIT, said the Centre has decided to eliminate single-use plastic from July 1, 2022 while the state implemented this from December 15. ""The state should have given more time to exhaust the remaining stock before imposing the ban. Besides, we need time to make alternate arrangement for plastic and thermocol.

The Times of India,"Patna: 'Switch to carpooling, use public transport to control air pollution' | Patna News - Times of India",,"PATNA: As the city's air quality index (AQI) continues to remain in the 'very poor' category, environmentalists have expressed concern over the blatant violation of pollution control measures both by the government departments and the people.

Talking to this reporter on National Pollution Control Day on Thursday, Ashok Kumar Ghosh, the chairman of the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB), said contractors, engineers as well as government officials hardly followed the correct procedure while engaging in construction activities and generated huge quantities of dust.

""The BSPCB has written several letters to the urban development, building construction and road construction departments, asking them to use screens in repair and construction works, but they don't do so. It is natural that the AQI of the city will increase,"" Ghosh said and asked all the stakeholders to cooperate in the implementation of environmental laws to keep the city clean.

He added, ""Vehicular emissions also lead to air pollution. People do not switch off the engine of their vehicles while waiting for traffic clearance. This generates toxic gases.""

Atul Aditya Pandey, the chairman of the State Environment Impact Assessment Authority, claimed that the geographical location of the city was such that the generation of dust, particularly in winters, could not be checked completely. He continued, ""Screen covers should be used during construction works and water sprinkled on the roads. Uncertain changes in temperature due to climate change are also causing air pollution.""

Dilip Kumar Paul, the coordinator of environmental science course in Patna University, pleaded for developing a sound system of solid waste management in the city to ensure a clean environment. ""With a view to minimizing the level of pollution due to vehicular emissions, people should use public transport or switch to carpooling. In the winter season, they should stop burning wood, coal, and even garbage for warmth and comfort,"" he advised.

The Times of India,midc:  Navi Mumbai: NCP activists protest over tree cutting at MIDC plot | Navi Mumbai News - Times of India,,"NAVI MUMBAI: The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) workers led by the party's national general secretary Saleem Sarang held a protest outside the MIDC industrial plot owned by Goodwill group at Pawane over the cutting of at least 28 big trees earlier this year.

Talking to mediapersons during the protest on Thursday, Sarang said: ''Since February this year, when the strict lockdown was enforced, around 28 green and healthy indigenous trees inside the MIDC plot C-3/C at Pawane were illegally cut. I have been repeatedly asking MIDC through RTI as to how they could allow this massacre of trees, especially in the protected marginal space area along the plot periphery. However, since I have not got any proper reply, the NCP has decided to protest as damage to environment affects us all.''

Adding that most of the killed trees were over 40 years old at the plot, Sarang added that the hacked trees included Peepal, Tamarind among other Indian species. ''Previously, the industrial unit of M/s Shree Ganesh Forgings Pvt Ltd, was at this Pawane site. However, once the Goodwill group took over, the industry was first declared ''sick''; and now real estate property is being developed here. However, our primary question is why good and healthy trees along the vital marginal space were killed. I will move court if required, because trees give us oxygen which was highly necessary during the pandemic when people were desperate to buy oxygen for covid patients,'' said Sarang.

Meanwhile, the Navi Mumbai based MIDC officials in the regional office (RO) have assured the protesters that an inquiry has been initiated on this issue.

When asked about massive tree cuttings at other MIDC plots too -- such as the 'P2' plot at Mhape Naka in Ghansoli node -- Sarang said: ''I am aware that at least 150 green and fruit-bearing trees were illegally hacked at the P2 plot near Mhape Naka recently. The MIDC is perhaps only thinking of business and not about environment and climate change. If green cover in MIDC areas continues to be destroyed, it will directly impact public health.''

The NCP protesters held colourful placards and posters depicting powerful messages on the need to save and protect trees during the protest, in order to safeguard human beings and other living species on the planet.

The protesters also mentioned about a previous FIR lodged against ''unknown persons'' at Vashi police station for illegally poisoning two huge rain trees just outside the Apna Bazaar plot in sector 17, which was coincidentally taken over by Goodwill group. ''Trees are being slyly poisoned by 'unknown persons' or brazenly chopped in various city areas. This is a serious issue that needs to be taken up by the highest state office,'' said Sarang.",2021-11-25T16:46:00Z
The Times of India,"Borge Brende: World Economic Forum president lauds India's pandemic response, reforms | India News - Times of India",,"NEW DELHI: World Economic Forum (WEF) president Borge Brende has lauded the Modi government's ""agile"" response to the COVID-19 pandemic, its commitments at the recent COP26 summit and the structural reforms undertaken by it to boost the economy.

In a piece which has been posted on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's website, he said that India has a unique opportunity and an important role in fostering regional cooperation in South Asia, thus creating new opportunities for growth and prosperity.

Noting the structural reforms effected in the last few years by the government to boost the long-term outlook of the economy, he said it's vision to catalyse India's transformation is evident in the launch of initiatives such as the Gati Shakti National Master Plan and the 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' mission.

Praising the government for placing due emphasis on manufacturing, Brende said, ""With the reshoring of global supply chains and quest for geographical diversification in their redistribution, India offers a safe and stable destination and could emerge as an important hub for global manufacturing.""

India has a demographic advantage, skilled workforce, technical know-how, and the research and development capacity needed to create a strong niche for itself in the global market, Brende said.

Referring to the national infrastructure pipeline and the national monetization plan to boost infrastructure development, he said these wide-ranging development agenda supports initiatives across multiple sectors, including reforms to consolidate many disparate labour laws, drafting of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, and banking reforms.

He also applauded India's renewed focus on the space sector via the recently launched Indian Space Association, and said the country can emerge as an important hub for global manufacturing.

Lauding India's handling of the pandemic, Brende wrote, ""Despite the economic devastation caused by the virus, India's agile response has been commendable, especially as the country rallied to manage a deadly second wave of the virus early in 2021.

""India was the first country to feel the impact of the virulent Delta variant but quickly swung into action to ensure that as many people as possible were vaccinated. One billion doses of the vaccine have already been administered.""

In addition to protecting its own population, India has also acted in the world's best interest by providing medical supplies and equipment to more than 150 countries and placing a critical supply of the COVID-19 vaccine on the world market, he said.

""Indeed, the pandemic is an inflection point for India to introspect on its potential as a global leader, especially coming at a time when the country is celebrating 75 years of independence,"" added Brende.

Appreciating India for meeting global commitments on climate change mitigation, he said India is well ahead of target to achieve other ambitious commitments such as making renewables 40 per cent of its energy mix by 2030 and managing the sequestration of 2.5 billion tonnes of carbon.

Praising Modi's 'Panchamrit pledge' at the ongoing COP26 Summit in Glasgow, he said that it will see the country address five key sectors of its economy as a means to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.

Mentioning India's reform trajectory, Brende wrote that it is marking 30 years since the deregulation of its economy, which is another significant turning point in its history and a testament to its ability to reinvent itself.

""The current administration's efforts to promote digital empowerment and last-mile financial inclusion are especially noteworthy. Under the auspices of a government-backed digital payment system, millions of poor, unbanked families have entered the formal economy and can now access basic financial services,"" he said.",2021-11-10T12:56:00Z

The Times of India,SMC to meet 35% power demand via renewable sources | Surat News - Times of India,,"Surat: The Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) is probably the only municipal corporation in the country that has developed infrastructure to produce almost 35% of its annual energy demand through renewable sources.

SMC is producing electricity through wind, solar and biogas-based power plants. Functioning at their full capacity, these plants can generate total 51-megawatt (MW) electricity annually.

Another green power generating unit will be added to the SMC's list when chief minister Bhupendra Patel inaugurates SMC's seventh wind power plant (WPP) of 6.3 MW on Friday. The plant has been set up at cost of Rs 42.45 crore in Sukhsan village of Kutch. It can generate 1.82 crore units annually and has a lifespan of 20 years.

SMC's annual power demand is 28 crore units while its renewable energy production capacity is 9.9 crore units.

""SMC is probably the only municipal corporation that has developed renewable energy infrastructure that can produce 35% of its annual energy requirement. We are consistently working on this front while also focusing on innovations to further improve renewable energy production,"" said city municipal commissioner, Banchhanidhi Pani.

SMC setup its first WPP in November 2010 at Gosa village in Porbandar and since then a total six WPP have been developed in Jamnagar, Porbandar and Kutch. Total production of power through WPP is 38.7 MW. SMC has also developed 7 MW solar power plants and 5.35 MW biogas power plants.

""By producing renewable energy, we have managed to bring down our annual greenhouse gas emission by 70,000 tonnes. It is a major contribution to counter the effects of climate change,"" said K H Khatwani, additional city engineer, SMC.

SMC has so far invested Rs 216 crore for setting up of renewable power generation plants.

Hindustan Times,"Approach NGT with challenge to 2019 CRZ notification, Bombay HC tells NGO",,"The Bombay high court (HC), while disposing of public interest litigation (PIL) wherein the 2019 Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) notification had been challenged by Vanashakti, a non-government organisation (NGO) has permitted it to approach the National Green Tribunal (NGT) with its grievances.

The Bombay high court (HC), while disposing of public interest litigation (PIL) wherein the 2019 Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) notification had been challenged by Vanashakti, a non-government organisation (NGO) has permitted it to approach the National Green Tribunal (NGT) with its grievances. The court further observed that as the Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) for Mumbai was finalised, the tribunal should decide on the representation by the NGO expeditiously.

The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice MS Karnik which had heard the PIL and reserved its order on October 7 observed that as the tribunal had been granted wide powers to cover almost everything under the sun it would not be appropriate on its part to pass orders on the objections raised by the petitioner.

""Regard being had to the wide contours of the tribunal's powers to address all concerns pertaining to the environment, it would not be appropriate for us to entertain this writ petition on the specious ground that issues relating to the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices (MRTP) Act may also incidentally arise for consideration of the tribunal,"" noted the bench in its order adding ""We are also minded to observe that no court ought to interfere in respect of matters over which the tribunal has jurisdiction, or else the very purpose for enactment of the NGT Act would stand defeated.""

The NGO which was represented by senior counsel Venkatesh Dhond and advocates Zaman Ali and Akash Rebello had been informed that the notification issued under the Environment (Protection Act), 1986 issued by the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) was challenged on the ground that some of its provisions were manifestly arbitrary and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution. Dhond had argued that the notification also violated the right to live in a healthy environment, and consequently violated the right to life of citizens protected by Article 21.

The NGO had also submitted that the notification contained provisions which were a reenactment of provisions earlier struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court or have been read down by the Supreme Court in earlier judgments. In light of these submissions, the NGO sought to declare that the notification was illegal and ultra vires Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution and to declare that the 2011 notification continued to be valid and binding.

""The unconstitutionality of the regulations is extensive, wide-ranging, comprehensive and far-reaching. Rather than protecting and improving the quality of the environment or preventing and controlling environmental pollution, the notification instead removes various protections which were present in CRZ 2011,"" stated the petition.

However, advocate Parag Vyas for the central government opposed the plea and said that the notification was consistent with environmental laws and sought dismissal of the plea as it was not maintainable before the HC as the issues could be dealt with by the NGT.

The court held that it could not entertain the plea and interfere in the 2019 decision. It noted, ""Since the CZMP for Mumbai has been finalised, we grant petitioner to approach before the NGT. The NGT will expeditiously decide the plea.""",2021-10-08T19:32:00Z
The Times of India,Green rides help Delhi Metro earn Rs 19.5 crore through carbon credits in 6 years | Delhi News - Times of India,,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has earned Rs 19.5 crore in six years from the sale of 3.5 million carbon credits.

These credits are tradable certificates, which enables DMRC to sell credits earned from its greenhouse gas (GHG) emission-reducing projects to other organisations, who need to compensate for their GHG emissions.

Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC, said that Delhi Metro became the first Metro or railway project in the world to be registered by the United Nations under the clean development mechanism (CDM) in 2007, which enabled DMRC to claim carbon credits for its regenerative braking project.

""CDM is a project-based GHG offset mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol allowing the public and private sector in high-income nations the opportunity to purchase carbon credits from GHG emissions-reducing projects in low or middle-income nations as part of their efforts to meet international emissions targets under the protocol,"" Dayal said.

The 3.5 million carbon credits were collected over a period of six years from 2012 to 2018.

""DMRC has been a pioneer in India in quantifying climate change benefits from its operations. It has a number of dedicated projects to its credit oriented towards energy efficiency,"" he said.

Dayal said that CDM projects generate emissions credits called certified emission reductions, which are then bought and traded.",2021-09-27T07:42:00Z
The Hindu,Back in the game: Quad and India-U.S. ties,,"India must cooperate with U.S. on vaccines, trade, and leverage Quad for regional stability

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's summit meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden, and his first in-person meet of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue mark an important step forward in India's engagement with major global powers as it seeks to revive its economy and strategic role in the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis. At the heart of the two leaders' meeting was the issue of vaccine availability -- and a critical victory for the Biden administration as it received Mr. Modi's assurance that as the world's largest vaccine manufacturer, India would resume supplies to the global COVAX pool under its 'Vaccine Maitri' programme. The breakthrough comes after turmoil in this space earlier this year, when India halted exports after facing criticism for domestic supply bottlenecks as it contended with a devastating second wave of COVID-19. Around the same time the U.S. also invoked its Defense Production Act, effectively preventing the export of raw materials for vaccine manufacture in a bid to prioritise domestic production. With both countries now moving forward on their domestic vaccination programmes, albeit with the U.S. still struggling to overcome vaccine hesitancy in certain States, the summit provided them a timely opportunity to take up long-pending conversations on trade, defence ties and more. At the confluence of those two areas was the reaffirmation by Mr. Biden that India remained a 'Major Defence Partner', making it a key nation with which Washington could share information and strengthen cooperation in advanced military technologies, including, for example, a recent project to co-develop air-launched unmanned aerial vehicles.

Issues of global concern, including the ongoing pandemic, climate change, technology cooperation, supply chains and security, and preserving a free and open Indo-Pacific were themes that came up at the Quad gathering. Following on the heels of the first virtual summit of the four leaders in March 2021, this meeting builds upon the intention of the Quad member nations -- India, the U.S., Australia, and Japan -- to ensure an Indo-Pacific region ""free from coercion and disputes... solved in accordance with international law"". While India has sought to disassociate its role as a member of the Quad from the recently announced Australia-U.K.-U.S. (AUKUS) partnership, there is little doubt that the creation of a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines for Australia under the AUKUS framework will have significant and positive implications on India's strategic calculus regarding the Indo-Pacific region. From New Delhi's perspective, health concerns and economic revival remain at the very apex of the policy agenda. This is a time for India to rapidly deepen cooperative initiatives with the U.S. regarding vaccines and trade and continue engaging vigorously with the Quad for regional stability. That is the optimal strategy to navigate the uncertain global ecosystem that it now finds itself in.",2021-09-26T18:51:00Z
Hindustan Times,A tale of two visits and a shift in Indian foreign policy,,"Last week India hosted two important visitors - Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, and the US special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry. These were routine visits, one to lay the groundwork for a potential Russian presidential visit to India and the other to assess Indian intentions on climate

Diplomatic visits, more often than not, are routine, more a function of bureaucratic necessities than of any real strategic significance. Most visits of foreign dignitaries to India or elsewhere hardly transform the underlying dynamic of the bilateral relationship. But sometimes, the tone and tenor of the engagement manages to convey more than either side perhaps intends to, thereby hinting at a fundamental transformation.

Last week India hosted two important visitors - Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, and the United States (US) special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry. They did not come to sign any major documents or make dramatic declarations. These were routine visits, one to lay the groundwork for a potential Russian presidential visit to India and the other to assess Indian intentions on climate. But these short visits revealed much more about the state of play in India-Russia and India-US ties than any formal policy document.

While Lavrov asserted that India and Russia ""are tied through a strategic partnership and at the heart of our partnership is the long-lived friendship between our nations and proximity of our stance on relevant international issues and our friendship,"" it was evident that the partnership is drifting away from its strategic orientation.

Differences have mounted, as the prism of the two nations to view the changing world order are substantively different. For a partnership that claims to be historical, Russia's decision to speak on behalf of China on matters from the Indo-Pacific to the Quad underscores for India a sad reality of a partner that is in terminal decline requiring the crutches of China to showcase its viability as a global power. While, in the past, Lavrov had commented on how Indian foreign policy decisions are being shaped by other powers, this visit saw him attempting to shore up Pakistan as the central pillar of Russian South Asia policy. From trying to ensure that New Delhi is kept out of the Afghan peace process to reportedly offering a blank cheque to Pakistan, Russian foreign policy has indeed come a long way.

Kerry, on the other hand, was in India to engage the country's leadership on increasing climate ambition ahead of Joe Biden's Leaders' Summit on Climate to be held later this month and the COP26 meet scheduled for later this year. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is part of the 40 world leaders Biden has invited to a virtual summit on climate, aimed at underlining the urgency and the economic benefits of stronger climate action.

Soon after taking office, Biden led the US back into the Paris climate accord. India's role is critical in ensuring that global targets are achieved. From being on the opposite sides of the ideological divide, the two democracies are now working more closely than ever on climate action -- notwithstanding differences on issues such as a timeline for net zero emission goal.

These two visits firmly underscore the new operational realities of Indian foreign policy. There is no denying the fact that in an ideal world India would like to have excellent ties with both Russia and the US. In fact, for New Delhi, there is much to be gained by strengthening its ties with Moscow, something that Indian diplomacy has been trying hard to do over the last few years.

Finding new areas of cooperation, moving the relationship away from its unidimensional nature of excessive dependence on defence ties, boosting energy and trade ties, keeping high levels of communication open -- all of this has been done. Yet, the relationship has failed to improve significantly. In an ideal world, Russia would have great ties with the West and it would be engaged in the Indo-Pacific, giving the region greater heft vis-à-vis China. But that's what India would like to see happen, not Russia.

For Russia, its primary preoccupation is its growing rivalry with the West and if China helps it in pushing back against the West, then it is all for the best. Sentimentality in foreign policy is the worst possible response. While it is true that India needs Russia for its defence needs and for managing various regional issues, foreign policy is not a one-way street. India cannot keep on hoping for outcomes that Russia is not willing to deliver.

As the recent episode of the US 7th Fleet asserting navigational rights inside India's EEZ without requesting India's prior consent underlined, New Delhi and Washington too continue to have differences on a range of issues. From trade and human rights to defence purchases from Russia, challenges are significant and, sometimes, not prone to an easy resolution.

But what is different is that the India-US relationship is New Delhi's strategic partnership of this century, where the two partners have a similar frame of reference to map out their strategic challenges and so are willing to work together to manage differences. Something that was true of the Indo-Soviet partnership in the 20th century.

It's a different world out there today and there is no use complaining about change. Nations nimble enough to adapt rapidly are often the ones which emerge as the leaders.",2021-04-13T12:44:00Z
The Times of India,What the city lost in the 20-year journey from 'Gaon' to 'Gram' | Gurgaon News - Times of India,,"From central Delhi to Gurgaon is not too far. Barely an hour or so by car. But in 2000, the approximately 30km felt distant, psychologically if not physically. Yet we, like many before us and many after, chose to begin life anew in this then small town to the south of the Capital.

Here was a city rising out of scrub and farmland, not yet the Millennium City of ambition but an escape for harried Dilliwallas eager for release from the chokehold of smoggy air, gridlocked roads and high rents. Back then, there were more goats and donkeys than cars on the roads, and you'd often spot a pastoralist with his herd. More importantly, you could breathe without having to worry about endangering your lungs.

Power cuts were plenty, often triggered by fierce summer storms that would come out of nowhere, the more intense because they had the topography all to themselves, unhindered by glass-and-chrome office buildings, apartment towers or the ubiquitous mall.

Still, life was better. We felt healthier, in body and in mind, because we coexisted with the environment. Nature had her rhythms, we had ours, and for the most part, neither got in each other's way.

But, so much has changed in 20 years that the Arcadia of that time feels more like a century removed than a couple of decades. Now, polluted skies, heaps of uncollected garbage, rundown infrastructure and shrinking open spaces (as Gurgaon expands ever more southwards) have become our crosses to bear.

And the once-in-a-century health emergency that is the Coronavirus has only served to highlight the parlous state of our well-being, urban and civic, environmental and personal. It has come to be this way because over time, too many diverted their eyes from what was happening all around, and allowed concrete to colonise lake, wetland and forest. We became preoccupied with creating a Singapore but elected to ignore the administrative example of the Asian city state.

Somewhere down the road, wealth became more valuable than health.

So, while the vaccine for Covid-19 might still be months away, Gurgaon can at least begin to nurse its environment back to healthiness. And her residents have an antibody within reach - community endeavour.

Reboot, restore, renew

Through late March and into April, Gurugrammers, confined to their homes, finally experienced what it meant to live without the threat of particulate matter (and other toxins) attacking their respiratory systems.

And accustomed as we are to murk and haze for much of the year, the sight of blue sky was one to behold.

The difference between the end-of-the-world gloom of post-Diwali and the cerulean skies of spring could not have been starker, especially to those who struggle to breathe (this writer included). But, could it last?

Well, that old normal, which was anyway never 'normal', hasn't returned. There's every chance it might. It all depends on whether we have the willpower to change our ways, individually and collectively.

For, if anything demonstrates the disregard for public hygiene, and the dereliction of administrative duty, it is the mountain of waste lying unattended in Bandhwari, poisoning the soil and groundwater, and fouling the air.

While city societies and RWAs have commendably led the way in segregating household waste, such initiatives have succeeded in isolation, and our city won't be able to breathe easy - literally and metaphorically - so long as that hellish mound continues to remind us of our thoughtlessness.

Speaking of hills, the Aravallis that surround us once played the role of ecological custodian of the region. Now, stretches lie denuded of green cover, leaving flora and fauna pitted in a battle against humanity's worst instincts. Contrary to the arguments of denialists, climate change is a reality, and the disappearing Aravalli biodiversity leaves us more exposed to dust devils and rainstorms.

Still, as wretched as it has been, 2020 offers the world the chance to press reset.

In Gurgaon, it affords us the opportunity to prove that growing the economy and nurturing the ecology can be achieved side by side. We can find a happy equilibrium and, alongside, live the Gurgaon dream.

It's a dream realised by the elderly, who found the untouched vistas here ideal for quiet retirement. It's a dream realised by the aspiring Indian, eager to make a life for themselves and to taste the trappings of success. It's a dream realised by the self-made and the entrepreneurs, women and men who have transformed Gurgaon into a happy hub for startups. Each has embraced this city as home, marvelling at how it has grown (not always in the most sustainable of ways) in front of their own eyes.

Gurgaon can still be a magnet but only if we have the patience and determination to tend to it. Which means building to blend into the landscape. Designing infra that thinks less of the motorist and more of the pedestrian and cyclist. Setting aside space for parks and gardens, for the children as much as for the elders. Managing all waste - household, plastic, electronic, and construction & debris - intelligently and sensitively. And, increasing forest cover, inside and outside municipal limits, by planting more indigenous trees (as, again, communities have done on their own steam).

Crucially, we need to recognise that the future of Gurgaon is tied with the renewal of the Aravalis. If these hills revive, so will we. Because a healthy Aravali bionetwork ensures a healthy Gurgaon. And a healthy Gurgaon means less chance of folks checking out of the city.",2020-07-05T02:36:00Z
The Times of India, Reforms must to play larger global role: S Jaishankar | India News - Times of India,,"NEW DELHI: In a world which is ""fractured... with polarised debates"", India is willing to step up to the plate and play a larger global role, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Monday.

Addressing a conference by the Centre for Policy Research here on Monday, he said India's challenge is ""undertaking deep reforms and addressing long-standing governance issues.""

Referring to the emerging geopolitical landscape, Jaishankar said Indian strategy will have to be more ""complex and nuanced in a world which is changing faster than we can imagine, as we struggle to absorb a nationalistic America, a rising China, a divided Europe, a re-emerging Russia, a normalising Japan, an insecure ASEAN, and an even more disturbed Middle-East. Other continents and regions are not without their own challenges, including ours. Economic rebalancing has now started to translate into its political manifestation. And that means a fundamental overhaul of the global architecture"".

The ""rebalancing"" of the world, he said, is ""accompanied by growing nationalism across vast geographies. There is no question that the overall mood is more competitive; some would say more selfish. The very nature of politics has changed in different societies and the disapproval of those who lost out does not make it less legitimate"".

Multi-lateralism is a casualty, alliances have eroded as the US has changed its own outlook and demeanour, he said. Interestingly, this opens up the space for ""pluri-laterals"" and coalitions of the willing, as well as middle powers, like India which find greater space. ""Perhaps it is only logical that India should emerge as an industry leader in this regard, whether it is the RIC, SCO, Quad or JAI,"" he said.

An equally big challenge comes from the fact that while supply chains, connectivity, terrorism, climate change and pandemics cut across national borders, there is less inclination among the big powers to coordinate and work together, he said.

The foreign minister said the economic challenges had multiplied. ""The world trading system has felt the pressure of gains that some accrued from structural advantages. At one stage, it had to turn political; it finally did. But today, this argument extends to non-trade domains like connectivity projects, technology choices, data protection and security as well as IPR adherence. All of them have strategic connotations...""

He said India's economic decisions in terms of trade and opening up have acquired a different complexion. ""Our economic engagement with the world also requires careful deliberation and effective preparation lest we end up eroding our own capacities ... it is a complex exercise that deserves serious strategising.""

He said India had made a difference to international outcomes in recent years. ""Whether it is in terms of technology, best practices or resources, there is a proclivity to partner with a nation whose prospects are clearly so assured. ... We have significantly shaped the connectivity debate at a time when the world was still confused. And backed that up with a plethora of projects, including in our immediate neighbourhood. Our single-minded campaign against terrorism has brought that issue into sharp focus in key world forums,"" he said.

Calling for more ""sober conversations"", Jaishankar said, ""Not only has the landscape become more difficult but the very articulation of interests has come under challenge. Competition is not just amongst states but often within them, reflecting the tension between the older order and the emerging one. When ideologies, identities and history mix with business, politics and strategy, it can create a very potent cocktail.""",2020-03-02T22:54:00Z

The Times of India,December 2019 warmest in five Maharashtra cities since 1901 | Pune News - Times of India,,"PUNE: An India Meteorological Department (IMD) winter analysis has revealed that December last year had the warmest night temperatures since 1901 in at least five cities in Maharashtra -- Pune, Ratnagiri, Malegaon, Kolhapur and Dahanu.

The December 2019 nights were the fourth warmest for Mumbai in the IMD's recorded history (1901) and second warmest for Aurangabad and Solapur. The data revealed that the average night temperature in Maharashtra was the highest after 1967.

At least 11 cities in the state broke the minimum temperature records for experiencing one of the warmest Decembers since 1901. All these cities have recorded the warmest December nights during recent decades, especially after 1960.

Arvind Kumar Srivastava, head of the Climate Research Division (Climate Research and Services) IMD-Pune, told TOI that not only Maharashtra, but the entire south peninsular India experienced the second warmest average minimum temperature in December 2019 in recorded history.

He said, ""The average minimum temperature for Maharashtra in December 2019 was 17.5ºC, which was the warmest December average the state has seen in the past 52 years or after 1967 when the average December night temperature was 17.95ºC. Maharashtra, meanwhile, recorded the third highest December average minimum since 1901 this winter.""

Srivastava said to have such warm night temperatures during winter was rare but not incredible, considering the larger climate change and global warming scenario. ""Climatologically, we have noticed a trend that when north India is cool during the season, south India tends to record relatively warmer minimum temperatures,"" he said.

The warming trend this winter indirectly suggested copious moisture incursion into Maharashtra, as well as south peninsular India. ""But long-term humidity data will have to be studied to see if there has been an unprecedented increase in humidity levels in the last few months,"" Srivastava said.

""This winter, the anti-cyclones from the Arabian Sea were constantly blocking the flow of cold and dry northerly winds originating from the snow-clad regions of the Himalayas. While these winds could enter north India, their entry to south peninsular India, including Maharashtra, was blocked,"" he added.

The wind regime was also such that the moist westerlies from the Arabian Sea or warm and humid easterlies were influencing the minimum temperatures in Maharashtra during most of winter. ""As far as the high night temperatures witnessed this winter in many cities of Maharashtra and south India are concerned, there was an influence of local factors like soil topography and vegetation that also played a role in pushing up minimum temperatures in those stations,"" Srivastava said.",2020-02-04T07:41:00Z
The Times of India,"Submit report on waste plant, NGT tells Chandigarh administration | Chandigarh News - Times of India",,"CHANDIGARH: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the UT administration to submit a detailed report on the functioning of the Jaypee garbage processing plant at Dadumajra.

UT adviser Manoj Parida, municipal corporation commissioner K K Yadav and UT chief conservator of forests Debendra Dalai appeared before the NGT on Friday in connection with cases related to water pollution, solid waste management and air pollution.

The officials submitted a detailed presentation of construction and demolition waste plant, legacy waste bio mining plant, bio medical waste plant and functioning of sewage treatment plants in the city. The NGT members were 'impressed' with the steps taken by the administration in other areas but not satisfied with the functioning of the garbage processing plant.

Recently, the NGT had directed Justice Pritam Pal (retd) committee to review the solid waste management situation in Chandigarh. The NGT has even sought a report from the panel on or before January 31, 2020.

Earlier, the committee had been looking into the pollution at river Ghaggar.

The civic body and the Jaypee plant are at loggerheads over the processing of garbage at the Dadumajra site.

The latest tribunal order stated, ""We are informed that the committee constituted by the tribunal in original application to oversee the compliance of Solid Waste Management Rules-2016, headed by Justice Pritam Pal is still in operation. The committee must furnish a report.""

Recently, another committee formed by the NGT had submitted in its report that 25,000 metric tonne unprocessed mixed waste has been lying at the garbage processing plant. The report was placed before the NGT during its resumed hearing in connection with the solid waste management system in the city. On this, the NGT had asked the civic body to complete the task by March 31, 2020.

The committee formed by the NGT comprised Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee (CPCC) member secretary, representative of Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) and Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change, and a professor from Punjab Engineering College, Chandigarh.

The CPCC had even sought a clarification from the MC as the NGT was keeping a close eye on the matter. In a letter, the CPCC had written that during their panel's visit to the plant on October 23, 2019, between 2pm and 3pm, the Jaypee management had submitted that the plant was accepting 150 metric tonne of waste a day, whereas the MC staff said the average waste that went there was 242.27 metric tonne a day. But till date, the MC failed to submit a reply. The CPCC had asked the MC commissioner to give clarification on the data mismatch.

Recently, the pollution panel had slapped a penalty of Rs 1.46 crore on Jaypee for violating environment rules while processing garbage at the dumping ground. The penalty was calculated at Rs 75,000 daily from February 20 to September 2. The notice was issued under Section 33-A of the Water (Prevention of the Pollution) Act, 1974, Section 31-A of the Air (Prevention of the Pollution) Act of 1981 and Section 5 of the Environment Protection Act of 1986.

The processing plant authorities had challenged the penalty before the tribunal.

The CPCC had earlier, too, issued a show-cause notice to Jaypee after finding various violations.",2020-01-11T03:38:00Z
The Times of India,Puducherry tops UTs in good governance | Puducherry News - Times of India,,"PUDUCHERRY: The Union territory (UT) of Puducherry topped the list of seven UTs in the country in the good governance index (GGI) released by the department of administrative reforms and public grievances.

Puducherry scored 4.69 points in the GGI followed by Chandigarh (4.68), Delhi (4.39), Daman & Diu (4.33) and Andaman & Nicobar Islands (4.12). Lakshadweep (2.97) fared poorly and was placed at the bottom of the table. Dadra & Nagar Haveli scored 3.12 points.

The department evolved a uniform tool, GGI, to assess the status of governance and impact of various initiatives taken up by state governments and UTs. The index was based on the performance of the states and UTs in 10 broad sectors.

Puducherry finished first in four areas - human resource development, public health, judicial and public security and environment. It came second in agriculture and allied sectors, third in public infrastructure and utilities and fourth in commerce and industries and economic governance and fifth in social welfare and development.

The index aims to furnish quantifiable data to compare the state of governance in the states and UTs and enable them to formulate and execute plans to improve governance. It also aims to encourage states and UTs to shift to result-oriented approaches and administrative practices.

The ranking in agriculture and allied sectors was based on the growth rate of food grain production, horticulture produce, milk production, meat production and crop insurance while ranking in commerce and industries was mainly based on ease of doing business. The human resource development ranking focused on quality of education, gender parity and retention rate at elementary level (grade one to eight).

Ranking in the public health sector was done mainly based on infant mortality and maternal mortality rates, while public infrastructure and utility ranking was done according importance to potable water and growth in per capita power consumption.

Economic governance ranking was based on growth in per capita gross state domestic product and state's own tax revenue receipts to total revenue receipts. The ranking in social welfare and development was based on rural employment guarantee and unemployment rate as indicators.

Judicial and public security ranking was based on conviction rate and availability of police personnel, while environment ranking was based on the change in forest cover and availability of action plan for climate change.

Lieutenant governor Kiran Bedi, while expressing happiness over Puducherry emerging as the best governed UT, thanked all who contributed to it in one form or the other. ""But, we have a long way to go. We know the areas demanding attention. But this is very encouraging for all rank and file and people at large. All public officials elected or appointed. Thank u. Let's do better still,"" she said.

Bedi lauded chief secretary Ashwani Kumar for leading the territorial team. ""Thank you for your respective contributions. Now let's take it up further in areas we are responsible for,"" Kiran Bedi said.

The department grouped the states into three categories -- big states, northeast and hill states and Union territories.

The Times of India,Patna gets 3 pollution quality monitoring stations | Patna News - Times of India,,"PATNA: Deputy chief minister (CM) Sushil Kumar Modi (SuMo) inaugurated three new air quality monitoring stations near the Shri Krishna Memorial Hall, Rajdhani Vatika (Eco Park) and Birla Institute of Technology (BIT) on Monday.

Up till now, the city had only one air monitoring station near the Indira Gandhi Science Complex, which was installed in 2011.

Speaking at the inaugural function, SuMo said, ""Keeping in mind the air quality of Patna, which keeps hovering between the 'very poor' and 'severe' categories, the state government and the Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) decided to install seven new air quality monitoring stations at different places. Three of them near the S K Memorial Hall, Eco Park and BIT have become functional now.""

The deputy CM added that two more air monitoring stations would be installed in the state capital by the first week of January.

""Work on installation of monitoring stations in Patna City and Danapur at the office of the divisional railway manager is underway and they will become functional in 15 days. Besides, an order has been placed for procurement of two more monitoring stations to be installed at Hajipur and Muzaffarpur,"" SuMo said.

The screens of the new monitoring stations will display not only the air pollution level, but also solar radiation, weather condition, humidity, wind speed and direction.

BSPCB chairman Ashok Kumar Ghosh, who was also present on the occasion, said a proposal had been mooted for installation of 42 new air monitoring stations across the state.

""Patna and Muzaffarpur have been listed as two of the most polluted cities in the country on the basis of the level of pollutants like PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 microns) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). Our aim is to bring down the pollution level in the coming years, for which various measures have been initiated, including ban on commercial vehicles that are more than 15 years old,"" Ghosh said.

Attributing the geographical position of Patna as one of the reasons for higher level of air quality index (AQI), environment, forest and climate change department's principal secretary Dipak Kumar Singh pointed out, ""Cities located near rivers have a comparatively higher AQI than other places. Alluvial soil and sand particles are few major reasons for higher levels of PM2.5 here. However, we can reduce pollution by adopting few measures like the use of eco-friendly fuel.""

Talking about the government's Jal-Jivan-Hariyali campaign, the deputy CM said all blocked rivers, rivulets, lakes, canals, local ponds and other sources in the state were being revived over a period of three years to allow free flow of water.

""The water bodies have already been recognized through satellite mapping and physical verification. Work on their rejuvenation will commence as soon they are made encroachment-free,"" he said.

SuMo also urged common people to participate in the government's initiatives of planting 2.51 crore trees all across the state.",2019-12-17T08:16:00Z
The Times of India,India's 46GW power plan stumbling block to climate goals: Report | Nagpur News - Times of India,,"Nagpur: The planned addition of 46 gigawatt (GW) in the country's coal power capacity between 2022 and 2027 will be a serious impediment in meeting the Paris climate goals. Also, the emissions of toxic carbon dioxide in the country rose by 4.8% last year with coal-fired power plants being the major sources, says the analysis 'Climate Action Tracker' (CAT).

Produced by global research organizations, CAT has been tracking progress of different countries towards limiting global warming to 1.5 degree Celsius. The report was discussed at international climate meet COP25 in Madrid on Tuesday.

For India to become a global leader in showcasing 1.5 degree Celsius mitigation pathways, the government must abandon plans to build new coal-fired plants, says CAT.

Currently, India has more than 200GW of operational coal-fired units. And, the country's National Electricity Plan (NEP) suggests a long-term increase in the overall capacity to nearly 300GW in the next few years.

""This will not just lead to more emissions but will also be inconsistent with the Paris Agreement. For countries in Asia, the compatible pathways suggest a 63% reduction in energy generation from coal by 2030, leading to a complete phase-out by 2037,"" the analysis states.

In 2017, coal consumption in the country reportedly increased by 27 million tonnes.

International analysts have also underlined the big risk of the coal-based power-generating assets being left in a state of disuse. ""Expansion plans for coal-based energy generation have been found to be inconsistent with lower demand projections. This is likely to exacerbate the issue of low utilization rates of coal power plants, impacting their profitability and threatening to compound the already perilous financial position of distribution companies,"" CAT stated.

Considering the declining cost of renewables, it should be the preferred choice for distribution countries. Bill Hare from Climate Analytics told TOI, ""It is clear that renewables are cheaper than coal these days, and nowhere is it clearer than in India where investors of renewables are pouring in. The country has to rid itself of coal by 2040.""

During the United Nations' Climate Action Summit which was held in New York three months back, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced scaling up the renewable energy target to 450GW by 2030. However, analysts are uncertain whether all renewable projects in pipeline ""will be completed on time and integrated in the grid"".

Says Hare, ""The government needs to urgently address this issue. Making renewables more accessible to the general population is a crucial part of decarbonizing society, something we all have to do to get to a 1.5˚C Paris Agreement pathway.""

The analysis also shows that under its current policies, India is likely to achieve its set climate target of 40% power generation from non-fossil fuel sources by 2030. ""But to be in line with the Paris Agreement and 1.5 degree Celsius goal, India needs to put a full stop to coal projects,"" analysts stated.",2019-12-10T18:09:00Z

Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, where the AQI touched 394, topped the list.

Track the pollution level in your city

However, a slight improvement was witnessed in air quality of Patna in the last 24 hours as it entered the 'very poor' zone on Sunday from 'severe' zone on Saturday.

According to the data released by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the AQI level in Gaya was recorded at 306, which is also considered 'very poor'.

Pradhan Parth Sarthi, professor at department of environmental science at Central University of South Bihar (CUSB) and president of Patna chapter of Indian Meteorological Society, said pollution level increased during daytime due to calm winds leading to accumulation of pollutants. ""Low wind velocity is generally observed because of cloudy weather in the Gangetic plains which creates smog conditions,"" he said.

Sarthi added, ""The AQI level decreases during night and morning because of blowing of winds due to western disturbances.""

According to a bulletin issued by Skymet Weather, dry winds from northwest region will continue to reach eastern states, including Bihar. ""Weather in eastern states will remain dry and shallow fog is possible over the next 48 hours,"" the bulletin read.

State environment, forest and climate change department's secretary Dipak Kumar Singh said PM 2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 microns) was the main reason for air pollution in Patna. ""Advisories have already been issued to several departments concerned to curb air pollution. Steps are being taken by the departments in this regard,"" he added.

On Sunday, PM 2.5 was the primary pollutant at 382 microgram per cubic metre (ug/m3), followed by nitrogen dioxide at 77 ug/m3, sulphur dioxide at 25 ug/m3, carbon monoxide at 52 ug/m3 and ozone at 78 ug/m3.

According to Bihar State Pollution Control Board, vehicle emissions contribute 32% in deterioration of air quality in Patna, sand mining 12%, heating 10%, constructions 7%, burning of garbage 7%, cooking fire 6% and brick kiln (4%).

Transport secretary Sanjay Kumar Agarwal said a mega drive against more than 15-year-old commercial vehicles will be launched from November 29. ""Teams will be constituted to carry out the special drive against vehicles causing air pollution. Two mobile vans will also be deputed to check the pollution level of vehicles,"" he said.

The Times of India,Bizmen demand PPCB to provide funds for Tajpur CETP | Ludhiana News - Times of India,,"Ludhiana: The Ludhiana deputy commissioner (DC) Pardeep Agrawal on Thursday organised a meeting with the stakeholders representing Common Effluent Treatment Plants (CETP) which are under construction in the city.

The agenda of the meeting was to check the progress of these CETPs and get feedback about the hurdles if any in its timely completion.

In the meeting, representatives of Punjab Dyers Association (PDA) too were present who apprised the DC about the current status of the CETP at Tajpur. Meeting turned a bit stormy after the PDA president Bobby Jindal accused the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) of deliberately trying to slow down progress of the treatment plant.

Giving more information Jindal said, ""From day one PPCB and state government have been taking things very lightly and the work of CETP at Tajpur is moving at a snail's pace. So far what little progress has been made is solely because of the efforts of the PDA members. We have already conveyed to the DC that at the present pace of work, the CETP will be able to see light of the day only in September next year which too is doubtful.""

Jindal added, ""Recently the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MOEF) too pulled up the PPCB and has asked the department to release a grant of Rs. 7.5 crore to PDA for the treatment plant, but even after that PPCB has so far given Rs 15 crore to us. Whereas it is on record that the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has already ordered MOEF to release Rs 15 crore share of central government for this CETP before December 31, but it is very unlikely that this too will happen as MOEF will release the share only if PPCB pays up its share of Rs 7.5 crore""

Pawan Garg, chairman of PDA said, ""PPCB should take up the matter of Tajpur CETP seriously as any small bit of laxity can cost us dearly and the Centre can pull back from this project just because of delay in contribution of state government's share of Rs 7.5 crore which is to be given by PPCB. We raised this point in the meeting and DC Agrawal has assured us that administration will speed up the work of this project at any cost.""

Notably on November 18, the MOEF had shot off a letter to PPCB to release grant of Rs 7.5 crore to PDA after which MOEF will release Rs 15 crore subsidy to PDA as per NGT orders.",2019-11-22T04:14:00Z
The Times of India,"Migratory birds arrive early, but count still low | Delhi News - Times of India",,"New Delhi: The Yamuna Biodiversity Park (YBP) officials were delighted when they espied a red-crested pochard in the nature reserve in September. The migratory bird, which generally makes its way to Delhi in mid-November, had arrived well in advance this year. This pattern of early arrival has been observed in most other places in Delhi, though the number of migratory birds has been lower than normal in some locations, including at YBP.

""After the initial red-crested pochard sighting, we have not recorded any more arrivals,"" admitted Faiyaz Khudsar, scientist in charge at YBP. ""The number of other avian visitors, such as the Eurasian coot, gadwalls and great cormorants, is also lower than what was recorded by this time last year.""

By the end of October, over 200 Eurasian coot had reached the biodiversity park in 2017 and 2018. In comparison, this year the figure hovers at 18-22 sightings. Similarly, the highest count for great cormorants till the end of October this year was 48 compared with 98 and 75, respectively, in 2018 and 2017.

Is pollution to blame for the fewer migrants? Khudsar says no. The problems back 'home', or the place from where the birds started their flight, are more pertinent, he said. ""For birds coming from Siberia, the variation in number could be because the temperatures there were higher than normal. This climatic change confuses the birds and affects their migration pattern,"" explained Khudsar.

The scientist added that good monsoons in the Rajasthan had created suitable wetlands for birds to nest, and they may have stayed there rather than fly to Delhi.

Nikhil Devasar, who generally keeps a check on birds in Sultanpur and its outskirts, said he was unable to give a clear picture about migration because heavy pollution had forced his group to cancel multiple birding sessions. ""The bird count has slowly started going up and we can expect more in December,"" Devasar said. ""It is tough to say if the number has been affected by pollution.""

Kanwar B Singh, another birder, pleaded the same, saying pollution had stopped their forays into bird habitats. Najafgarh, however, appeared more disturbed than normal, he said. ""We will conduct a winter bird count on November 24, which should give us more precise numbers,"" he assured.

Jaswinder Waraich refused to pinpoint the reason for the lower count but described the turnout at Okhla as 'disappointing' so far. ""Birds have their own preferences when it comes to nesting. There are cycles of good and bad years. The condition of the habitat also plays a major role in their arrival,"" noted Waraich.

Dr Surya Prakash, a zoologist at JNU, pointed out that some 'late' migratory species were yet to arrive, and a clear picture would likely emerge by end-December.

According to birders, the species that are here include the northern shovellor, pintails, gadwalls, common pochard, sandpipers, little stint, Eurasian curlew, booted eagle, Bonellis eagle, and warblers.",2019-11-12T04:04:00Z
The Times of India,IMD issues yellow alert for Mumbai today | Mumbai News - Times of India,,"MUMBAI: The India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued a yellow alert for Saturday, forecasting heavy rain at isolated places. From Sunday, it predicted light to moderate rainfall activity.

The 1,000 mm mark for rainfall in September was breached on Friday, with the total settling at 1,060.6 mm by 8.30 pm.

The morning brought heavy rain and localised water-logging in many areas, including Vile Parle, Sion and Gandhi Market in King Circle. From 8.30 am to 8.30 pm, rainfall recorded at the Colaba observatory of the IMD was 60.4 mm and at the Santacruz observatory, 49 mm.

Some days ago, rain for September crossed the previous record for highest rainfall, 920 mm in 1954.

The average September rain is 327.1 mm, a figure that was crossed this year in the first four days of the month.

Weathermen said the next significant rain spell could be expected near September 25.

""Rain activity will reduce for the next two to three days over Mumbai and suburbs as the cyclonic circulation which was over North Madhya Maharashtra has moved towards East Arabian Sea and intensified into low pressure area,"" Mahesh Palawat, vice-president, meteorology & climate change, Skymet Weather Services Pvt Ltd, said. ""It will further intensify and move away from Indian coast. Therefore, rain activity will gradually reduce.""

Palawat said the spell expected around September 25 would not be very heavy as the weather system may not be very severe. ""We think the heavy rain episodes for Mumbai are over, although very intense localised spells could occur,"" Palawat said.

For the overall monsoon season, the rainfall recorded by the Colaba observatory stood at 2,543.6 mm, which is 624.3 mm above normal. The Santacruz observatory recorded 3,557.1, which is 1,455.7 mm above normal.",2019-09-21T00:51:00Z

https://www.hindustantimes.com/,"Gurugram breathes its cleanest air this year; rain, humidity key reasons | gurugram | Hindustan Times",New Delhi,"In July 2018, Gurugram saw 17 moderate air days. This year, there were 3 good days, 14 satisfactory days so far.

Since Sunday, the city has been breathing its cleanest air of the year so far. Gurugram has had two consecutive days of ""good"" air as per the Central Pollution Control Board's (CPCB) air quality index (AQI).

On Monday, the city's daily AQI value stood at 39, down from 41 the previous day -- Gurugram's lowest AQI reading this year, which experts said could be attributed to meteorological conditions.

On Sunday morning, the concentration of the city's most prominent pollutant, PM2.5, dropped to a minimum of 2ug/m3, which is well below the safety threshold of 60ug/m3.

The daily average PM2.5 concentration on Sunday, meanwhile, was 22ug/m3. The level rose slightly to 34ug/m3 on Monday but remained in the ""good"" category of the AQI.

According to a CPCB forecast, air quality in Gurugram will remain in the ""good"" category for at least three more days, with a maximum AQI reading of 43.

Experts and officials said that these numbers are typical for July, which usually sees the city's most favourable air quality in its annual pollution cycle.

While the city was recognised as the most polluted in the world (concerning particulate matter concentrations) by a Greenpeace study last year, meteorological changes provide a much-needed respite during the rainy season, when precipitation and high relative humidity levels can significantly cut pollution levels.

In July 2018, the city did not see any ""good"" air days (when the AQI value dips below the 50 mark), though it saw 17 ""moderate"" air days, eight ""satisfactory"" air days, and one ""poor"" air day.

Data for five days in July last year was not captured due to a dysfunctional air quality monitor. The average AQI reading for the month was about 104 (moderate).

By comparison, this month so far has seen three ""good"" air days, 14 ""satisfactory"" air days, seven ""moderate"" air days, and two ""poor"" air days. Data for one day was not captured due to a dysfunctional air quality monitor. The monthly average AQI reading for July so far is around 111 (also moderate).

While the air is better this year than the same period last year, the region has seen a much drier monsoon in 2019.

""With a deficit in rainfall, pollution levels should be much higher this year, but it seems that they are only slightly higher,"" a senior scientist at the CPCB's air quality lab in Delhi said. He also pointed out that the number of ""satisfactory"" air days for July between 2018 and 2019 have increased, while ""moderate"" air days have decreased.

VK Shukla, head of the CPCB's air quality lab, added, ""The numbers are hopeful because rainfall has a large impact on air pollution levels."" Shukla said that he could not make a definitive comment about improvement in Gurugram's air quality without analysing the data firsthand, but said, ""We have been noticing gradual improvement year after year in the Delhi-NCR, so this fits the trend.""

Earlier this month, union minister of environment, forests and climate change Prakash Javadekar submitted data in the Parliament suggesting that levels of a prominent pollutant, PM10, have dipped by 20% between 2016 and 2018, dropping from an average of 278ug/m3 to 223ug/m3.

Javadekar also submitted that Delhi has had 33% fewer ""poor"" air quality days than two years ago.

Experts, however, said that the reduction in air pollution data should not be taken at face value.

A senior researcher with the Centre for Policy Research in Delhi, requesting anonymity, said, ""There are many data constraints, such as erroneous observations, poor data collection, and abnormal deviations, which make it incredibly hard to make definite inter-year comparisons. An increase in the number and spatial coverage of air quality monitors in the NCR is also likely to skew any accurate observations.""",2019-07-29T22:40:00Z

As a part of his yatra, Prof Solanki also interacted with the students at IIT-Kanpur campus.

Addressing the students, he said that it was the time to work on 'Energy Swaraj,' on the lines of Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy of 'Gram Swaraj'. Energy Swaraj is generation of energy by the communities for their consumption and needs.

The Indian leg of GGSY, scheduled to cover 50 Indian cities in the next one month, was kicked off on July 5, 2019 from Mumbai while the yatra was started by Prof Solanki from Mahatma Gandhi's Sabarmati Ashram in December 2018.

Till date, the GGSY has covered over 30 countries, and over 101 countries are on-board to conduct the Students Solar Ambassador Workshop scheduled to be held on the culmination of this yatra, on October 2 this year. Around eight lakh students have registered to be a part of this mega-global event, said the professor.

During this workshop, more than 10 lakh students will be given hands-on training in solar lamp assembly on October 2. The event is based on a similar workshop conducted in 2018 participated by more than 1.30 lakh students across India, Solanki said adding that the students keen to participate the event can visit https://www.ggsy.in/collaborate.php for details.

""The world in the current scenario has contradictory energy requirements, wherein on the one hand providing universal energy access while over-exploitation of energy is causing catastrophic climate change. The world is already hotter by nearly 1°C and it needs to adopt 100% Renewable Energy by 2050, according to the 2018 IPCC report. There is a need to look into the energy generation scenario"", he said.

Prof Solanki said that this noble cause based on the Gandhian principles of 'non-violence,' 'Swaraj' and 'self-sufficiency' was initiated on December 25, 2018 from Sabarmati Ashram, which has been synonymous to the Gandhian struggle for Independence. Prof Solanki has been travelling extensively to various countries to propagate the message of 'Energy Swaraj.'",2019-07-24T23:07:00Z
The Times of India,World Bank recognized state's excellence: CM | Thiruvananthapuram News - Times of India,,"Thiruvananthapuram: The World Bank (WB) choosing Kerala as its development partner, which is for the first time ever in its history, is a recognition to the excellence shown by the state in dealing with the flood and post-flood activities, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said.

""As part of this, the bank granted 500 million USD as development policy loan. The state will receive Rs 250 million USD as the first tranche. The loan is not being granted to any particular project. The state is at liberty to spend the funds for its development activities,"" he said in an article dispatched to media on Friday.

Following the Rebuild Kerala conclave held on Monday, the government will hold mass conventions, titled 'Janakeeyam Ee Athijeevanam' in all districts on Saturday to explain post-flood activities.

In the WB loan, $160 million has a moratorium of four years and 30 years repayment period at 1.5% interest. The remaining $90 million has a repayment period of 18 years, at an interest rate of 4 to 4.5%. Vijayan said that several agencies were part of the Rebuild Kerala development conclave. Other than country directors of the WB and Asian Development Bank, the conclave witnessed participation from Japan International Corporation Agency, representatives from the United Nations, AFD (French development agency), KFW (German bank), Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, Nabard, Hudco, Tata Trust and others. ""All partners took a sympathetic approach towards the state. The conclave ensured financial and technical support from them,"" Vijayan said.

The idea is not only to recover from the devastation caused by the floods, but also to overcome similar natural disasters and climatic changes in the future, the CM said. The state government is in the process of ensuring sustainable development through building a resilient state. ""Each project will be scrutinized in detail by a high-level committee before the cabinet gives its approval,"" he said.

Vijayan said that till date, the chief minister's distress relief fund received Rs 4,106.38 crore, and of this, Rs 2,041.34 crore has been spent. The remaining funds will be spent for various initiatives, including rebuilding the houses of fishermen community.

After the rescue operations, the government focused on reconstruction of essential facilities. As much as 16,954km roads had to be repaired and 25.6 lakh power connections had to be restored. The repair of 15,521 houses are being undertaken now. The rebuilding of the state is the next step of the restoration activities, he said.",2019-07-19T23:45:00Z
The Times of India,Your AC keeps you cool but it's the reason why you need it so much | Delhi News - Times of India,,"New Delhi: Air-conditioners (AC) may be cooling your home or office, but their inefficient usage is putting a great stress on energy consumption and heat levels outdoors. The hotter it gets, the more power is used. As the outdoor heat rises, it traps the city in a vicious cycle of more AC consumption, says a new study released by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) titled ""A Midsummer Nightmare"".

To stay thermally comfortable and do it sustainably, Delhi and other cities need to design their buildings in a manner to reduce the use of mechanical cooling systems. An eight-year trend analysis of energy consumption in Delhi showed no increase in demand when the heat index was within 25-32°C.

The study stated that the average electricity consumption during the peak heatwave days of June 7-12, 2019 increased by 25% as compared with the season's average. This trend is expected to worsen nationally as the heat index and climatic stress are continuously increasing. India's heat index is increasing at the rate of +0.56°C per decade during summer (March-May) and +0.32°C during monsoon (June-September).

In Delhi, 25-30% of the annual energy consumption is because of thermal stress, which occurs primarily due to concrete. In peak summers, it is said to be as high as 50%. Calling for designing buildings for reducing the heat load on them, promoting adaptive comfort, and cutting down over-dependence on air conditioning, CSE said better planning is required to change this trend.

""If the growing discomfort due to increasing heat is not addressed with wide-ranging architectural design solutions, mixed use of cooling approaches (including less energy-intensive devices like fans) and improved energy efficiency of mechanical cooling methods, India's energy security and climate change mitigation efforts will be deeply undermined,"" said CSE executive director (research and advocacy) Anumita Roychowdhury.

Rajneesh Sareen, programme director, CSE's sustainable habitat team, feels that the demand for space cooling in buildings is likely to explode even further, upsetting India's energy budget. ""Cooling energy consumption in buildings is likely to double in the next decade and become nearly four times in the next 20 years as compared to the 2017-18 baseline,"" he added.

Analysis of real-time data from State Load Dispatch Centre, Delhi for this summer, particularly the peak heatwave days of June 7-12, showed that the peak demand for electricity was higher and prolonged at night.

""This clearly shows that households are more vulnerable and lesser equipped to deal with increased heat stress and are aggressively using electricity inefficiently to survive uncomfortable nights,"" said Avikal Somvanshi, the report's author and programme managerat CSE's sustainable habitat team.

Between 2010 and 2019, botanists and taxonomists working on Impatiens -- a group of plants commonly known as Balsams or jewel-weeds -- discovered 23 new species from the eastern Himalayas. Consisting of both annual and perennial herbs, balsams are succulent plants with high endemism. Because of their bright beautiful flowers, these group of plants are of prized horticultural significance.

The details of the new species, including several new records, have been highlighted in the book , recently published by the Botanical Survey of India.

Authored by Rajib Gogoi and Souravjyoti Borah and other BSI scientists, the book presents 83 species, one variety, one naturalised species and two cultivated species of Balsams. Running over 200 pages, the publication provides a pictorial guide which can help ordinary people identify these group of plants. Of the 83 species described, 45 are from Arunachal Pradesh, 24 from Sikkim and 16 species common to both states.

Mr, Gogoi, who heads the Sikkim Himalayan Regional Centre of BSI and is behind most of these discoveries, said that the study on Impatiens was started by botanists like A. P. de Candolle William Roxburgh in the early 19 th century. Later, one of the most renowned botanists of all times, J.D. Hooker, worked on Indian and southeast Asian Impatiens from 1901-1911.

""After the British left India not much work has been done on Impatiens in from northeast India. Before this publication, the number of Balsam species in the eastern Himalayas was pegged roughly at 50 only,"" Mr Gogoi said. There are about 230 species of Balsams found in India and majority of them are found in the eastern Himalayas and Western Ghats.

It is also interesting to know how these scientists overcame difficulties in identifying these beautiful groups of plants. Prior to 2010, specimens of Impatiens that had potential of being identified as new species would be collected but the dried up specimens looked identical to the species discovered earlier and their effort yielded no results.

""After a few failed attempts, we understood where the problem lay and decided that the plants should be dissected in the field before being taken to the herbarium,"" Mr. Gogoi said.

Other than high endemism, what sets Impatiens apart is their sensitivity to climate change.

""Most of the species of Impatiens cannot endure persistent drought or extended exposure to direct sunlight. As a result Impatiens species are typically confined to stream margins, moist roadsides, waterside boulders, near waterfalls and wet forests,"" Mr. Borah said.

According to the scientists there are at least six Balsam species such as (I. adamowskiana, I. debalgensis, I. albopetala, I. ashihoi, I. idumishmiensis, I. rugosipetala) are confined only to one mountain beltin lower Dibang valley in Arunachal Pradesh. Some species of Balsams highlighted in the publication such as (I. lohitensis, I. pathakiana, I. pseudolaevigata, I. siangensis, I. xanthina) have high horticulture due to presence of big showy flowers.

Scientists and botanists behind the publication said the discovery of these new species was not enough. ""What is required is further research to create different hybrids with an adaptability to thrive in hot climate, "" Mr. Gogoi said.",2019-06-15T16:35:00Z
The Times of India,"Kolkata: Fence off Mollar Bheri, orders NGT | Kolkata News - Times of India",,"KOLKATA: The National Green Tribunal (NGT), in an interim order, has directed several measures to be taken for protection of the East Kolkata Wetlands (EKW).

The Tribunal will also look into allegations by environment activist Subhas Datta that illegal commercial activities were conducted at the Ramsar Site. The state may also have to reply why a 2011 order on not issuing any further 'no-objection certificates' for constructions was revoked in 2017. The NGT has directed the ministry of environment, forests and climate change as well as the central pollution control board to get involved in the clean-up.

The Times of India,"Karanji lake dries up, tourism flow hit | Mysuru News - Times of India",,"Mysuru: Karanji lake -- once a sprawling water body with a beautiful park around it -- has completely dried up, closing the doors on one of the major tourism spots in Mysuru.

The lake, spread over 230 acres, had water in almost half of its area till a few months ago, attracting migratory birds from faraway places. However, the tourism activity has come to a grinding halt with the lake turning dry. Boating was stopped in February itself, much before summer started.

The water body, which is maintained by the forest department, has earned good revenue all these years through gate collections. Hundreds of visitors thronged the campus that also has an open aviary and a playground for the kids and a display of love birds in enclosures. A butterfly park developed at the west end of the water body remains abandoned though there are plans to revive it too.

Efforts to rejuvenate the lake are going strong but these are yet to get a positive response. As soon as the lake went dry, officials cashed in on the opportunity to desilt the water body that has never been done in the past one-and-half decades to increase its water-holding capacity. At the same time, Mysuru zoo authorities wrote to Mysuru City Corporation seeking to provide treated water and also sought an endorsement from Karnataka State Pollution Control Board authorities to fill the lake. They have also been clearing weeds all along the only feeder channel to help free flow of water during monsoon.

It has been three months since zoo authorities sent a proposal to MCC and they're yet to receive a response from them.

Environmentalist Tanuja DH said water bodies are drying up everywhere, not just in Mysuru. This is because of climate change, she claimed. It is also a cycle for a water body to completely dry up. Some three decades ago, a similar situation took place with Karanji lake. ""Efforts are being made to fill up the water body with treated water and till now I didn't see anything happening in this regard. The only way is rains, which is the only and main source of water to Karanji lake,"" she said.

""After the lake started drying up, we discussed about it and decided to rejuvenate it with treated water. We sent a proposal to MCC twice in the past three months and are awaiting reply. We can't fill the water body with treated water available with MCC. We have to ensure that the quality is good. We have to get an assurance from pollution board authorities,"" said Ajith Kulkarni, executive director, Mysuru zoo.

""Moreover, we have made all efforts to increase the inflow of rain water during monsoon by taking up cleaning of weeds along the feeder channel,"" he added.",2019-05-29T00:17:00Z
https://www.hindustantimes.com/,Cyclone Fani: Odisha stares at ecological crisis ,Debabrata Mohanty,"Two of Odisha's ecological hotspots - Lake Chilka and Balukhand-Konark wildlife sanctuary -- may not be the same any more, thanks to Cyclone Fani that roared through the state on May 3 with wind speeds exceeding 200 km an hour, officials said on Thursday.

Chilka, Asia's biggest brackish water lake that earlier had two mouths, now has four more, stirring fears that salinity could increase by inflow of sea water and adversely affect marine life, the officials said. Over 4.5 million trees were uprooted by the cyclone in Balakhand, making it look like a ""wasteland"".

Cyclone Fani, which made landfall in Puri last Friday, has left a long trail of destruction along the coast, uprooting millions of trees, blowing away roofs and homes, and snapping power. Weather experts have termed Fani the most intense cyclone in the region in 20 years.

While it affected over 14 million people in Odisha's densely populated coastal districts, its impact on ecology and wildlife has been equally devastating, though an estimate of the damage has yet to be made. Most part of the ~17,000 crore the state government has sought from the Centre will go into putting people's lives back on track.

The Balukhand wildlife sanctuary on the Puri-Konark marine drive, which has over 4,000 spotted deer, a large number of wolves, monitor lizards and is visited by Olive Ridley turtles for nesting, has lost over 4.5 million trees. ""Most of the trees are either uprooted or broken. It's a Herculean task to clear the fallen trees and restore the sanctuary's ecology,"" said Harshabardhan Udgata, the divisional forest officer of the sanctuary. The sanctuary was home to around 9 million trees and only mangroves were able to resist the strong winds.

The loss of spotted deer was not much, Udgata said, but it would be difficult for them to tolerate the gruelling summers without the shade of trees. ""It will take us at least four months to clear the fallen trees. Planting new ones would only be possible in the next season. We are distressed thinking about the impact of the cyclone on wildlife,"" he said.

The cyclone also damaged lakhs of trees along the Bhubaneswar-Puri highway and on roads in Bramhagiri, Satapada, Krushnaprasad, Bhubaneswar, Cuttack, Khurda and several other areas. On Thursday, the Odisha forest department released information on the ecological impact of the cyclone, including Lake Chilka, which has been designated a world heritage site.

""Chilka lagoon had only two active mouths -- the point where it meets the sea -- before Cyclone Fani. Four new mouths have opened due to wave energy with high tidal prism and saline ingress to the lake,"" said Chilka Lake Authority chief executive officer Sushanta Nanda. ""Its effect on biodiversty is being assessed.""

A Bhubaneswar-based environment expert, Biswajit Mohanty, said the new mouths were a cause of concern to the health of the lake, but one would have to wait a few months to see if they remain open or close by natural deposition.

""It's important to monitor the lake's salinity, which may see unexpected fluctuations due to the inflow of sea water through the new mouths. This may also lead to changes in fish migration. Fish and aquatic plants may also be adversely affected if the salinity level goes up,"" he said.

""Chilka is home to about 150 species of migratory birds and endangered plants and animal species, apart from a source of livelihood for about 1.5 lakh fishermen in the region,"" Mohanty added. Another environment expert, Aditya Panda, said increase in salinity could impact swamps in the lake and it could be measured only though detailed scientific assessment. ""I am hopeful that Chilka will be able to revive itself,"" he said.

After an initial assessment, Panda said the flamingo, pelican and painted stork population was safe in the Nalabana sanctuary on Chilka lake. But the real ecological impact would be assessed only in the next few weeks, he said. In the Balukhand-Konark wildlife sanctuary, the forest department has estimated damage to nearly 5.5 million trees, which would affect around 400 spotted deer. ""Around 20% of the trees are uprooted and cannot be revived, while the remaining were found to be snapped or broken,"" said Jarsabardhan Udgatta, divisional forest officer of Puri wildlife division.

In Bhubaneswar's Nandankanan Zoological Park, animal enclosures have been destroyed and hundreds of trees uprooted. With the zoo shut indefinitely, monkeys have begun entering residential areas looking for food and water, zoo officials said.

The Odisha principal chief conservator of forests, Sandip Tripathy, said the damage to the green cover was so pervasive that it would take at least a decade to restore it. ""We have to ensure re-plantation of the uprooted trees to revive the green cover,"" he said. Mohanty suggested that the department should not plant trees such as casuarina and eucalyptus as they cannot withstand strong winds. ""It would be wise to plant trees like neem, karanj, banyan and local berries, which are endemic to the area,"" he said.

There is clear indication that because of climate change, the frequency and intensity of cyclones have increased in recent years, Panda said.

According to the fifth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, increase in surface temperatures over oceans, especially in the cyclone-prone Bay of Bengal, will increase the frequency and intensity of sea storms.

Odisha has witnessed three major cyclones since 2015 - Phailin, Titli and Fani. ""Cyclone Fani got intensity as surface temperature over Bay of Bengal got warmer by one degree Celsius over the long term average, according to NASA satellite data,"" said a Global Strategic Communication Council statement.India Meteorological Department director general K J Ramesh said there was a direct correlation between the intensity of cyclone Fani and climate change.

""Due to global warming, there is additional warming over all oceans; Bay of Bengal is no exception. Atmosphere is also very warm. The combination of the two makes cyclones last longer,"" he said.

Panda said the increase in frequency of cyclones, especially in the Bay of Bengal, should goad policy-makers to come up with a new action plan to tackle them. ""The storm blew away window panes of flats in high-rise buildings in Bhubaneswar and Puri and damaged household goods. This has not happened before. We need to do a rethink on how to save our cities from such cyclones,"" he said.",2019-05-10T01:43:00Z

The Times of India,RMC puts namkeen makers on notice over plastic plan - Times of India,Nimesh Khakhariya,"Rajkot: The Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) has issued an ultimatum to the local namkeen makers (packaged snacks) to come up with a detailed action plan for re-collection of the plastic wrappers used to package the snacks. The civic body has so far issued notices in this regard to 55 namkeen manufacturers, has called them for a meeting on April 15.

In recent years, Rajkot has become a hub for namkeen manufacturing with some locals emerging as national players. This has also led to problem of plastic waste generation in the city. The RMC's current drive is to curb the harmful trend, as most of the plastic wrappers non-recyclable.

In October last year, during a meeting with RMC, the manufactures had expressed their inability to carry out the re-collection of used plastic wrappers due to cost attached to it.

Now, with along with the ultimatum RMC has proposed that the namkeen makers increase the price of their product by 50 paise or a rupee to collect money for re-collection.

""As per the Plastic Waste Management Rules 2016 issued by union ministry of environment, forest and climate change, the namkeen makers have to frame a mechanism to re-collect their plastic waste and recycle it. They cannot escape their responsibility,"" RMC commissioner Banchha Nidhi Pani told TOI.

""The manufacturers have to offer some incentives to those who return the namkeen wrapper. Even rag-pickers can earn from it,"" he said, adding that rag pickers currently don't prefer to pick the namkeen wrappers because it is not accepted by recyclers.

The Plastic Waste Management Rules 2016 also stated that it is responsibility of the producers using multilayer plastic packing to set up a plastic waste re-collection system.",2019-04-12T22:33:00Z

However, FTC urged Christians in the two Telugu states to vote and elect secular and sincere leaders who are not corrupt, casteist, communal and crony capitalists. Special prayers will be offered on polling day in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and priests and pastors have been asked to read the pastoral letter in churches.

The pastoral letter signed by FTC general secretaries bishops Dr T Raja Rao, Dr V Prasada Rao and executive secretary Father Dr Anthoniraj Thumma said, ""In the upcoming elections, we must ensure the choice of those who uphold the democratic institutions and safeguard secularism which is in jeopardy in our beloved Motherland.

The Times of India,NGT orders curbs on groundwater extraction by amusement parks - Times of India,Shilpy Arora,"Gurgaon: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed a high-level committee to review the policy permitting supply of groundwater and canal water for commercial purposes in the city, and restricted further commecial use of such water.

The directive came after RTI activist Harinder Dhingra filed a petition in the NGT, alleging that the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (earlier known as Huda) illegally permitted commercial use of drinking water in an amusement (water) park in Sector 29.

The petition also claimed that the the amusement park authorities illegally installed tubewells to extract groundwater for commercial use. According to sources, the amusement park uses approximately 4,00,000 litres of water or more every day.

The NGT order, whose copy has been accessed by TOI, has also instructed the committee to find out if water from rivers is supplied for commercial use to the amusement park.

In its order, the green tribunal also referred to the TOI report -- 4 crore litres groundwater drawn illegally everyday in Gurugram -- published on June 6, 2017.

""Water from canal has been diverted by Huda for use for commercial purposes without any study on whether such diversion will affect the eco-system of the canal... We direct (the committee) to review the existing policy of permitting supply of water for commercial purposes, when there is scarcity of drinking water, and whether the water is being diverted from the river supply for commercial use, without affecting environmental flows. Decision may be taken within two months from today,"" stated the order, which was passed on March 25.

The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has been made a nodal agency in the matter. Meanwhile, the high-level committee, constituted by the NGT and including representatives of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC), CPCB, Central Ground Water Authority (CGWA) and the district magistrate of Gurgaon, has recommended that the park's operators explore the possibility of using treated waste water after making sure that the water's quality parameters are within prescribed limits.

The committee has also recommended constituting a State Ground Water Authority (SGWA) in Haryana.

""The committee recommended that sewage treated water may be provided and canal water supply may be disconnected, recharge of water be increased, diversion of drinking water for commercial purposes be discouraged, water park operators may use treated water"", according to the order.

Moreover, the committee has given detailed long-term and short-term strategies for proper monitoring of e-flow (environmental flow -- maintaining the quantity, timing, and quality of water flow required to sustain freshwater, estuarine ecosystems and human livelihood), and revival of water sources in the city.

While the short-term strategies should be implemented within three months, long-term strategies are to be implemented within nine months.

""I am glad that the committee (appointed by NGT) has not only restricted the commercial use of groundwater and canal water but also given recommendations to maintain environmental flow, revive village ponds, strengthen wastewater systems and revive local freshwater resources. Both the long-term and short-term strategies have to be implemented in a time-bound manner and will go in a long way in groundwater recharge and proper management of fresh water resources,"" said petitioner Harinder Dhingra.

Gurgaon has already been marked as a 'dark zone' by the CGWA. 'Dark zone' refers to an area where groundwater level has fallen beyond a prescribed limit.

Over the past 20 years, the groundwater level has declined in the entire district and the rate of decline is 0.77 to 1.2metre/year.

According to a CGWA report, the stage of ground water development in Gurgaon is 209%, which means that the net annual withdrawal is more than the net annual recharge. The green tribunal has listed the matter for further consideration on July 8, 2019.",2019-03-30T04:01:00Z
The Times of India,"Pay Rs 10 crore for environmental damage, NGT tells Ansals - Times of India",Shilpy Arora,"GURUGRAM: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed Ansal Buildwell and its sister concerns, Aadharshila Towers Private Ltd and Rigoss Estate Networks Private Ltd, to deposit an interim compensation of Rs 10 crore for violation of norms and environmental damage in Sushant Lok 3.

The amount has to be deposited with the Central Pollution Control Board within a month. The final compensation, to be assessed within three months, is set to be much higher.

The directions were given in a petition filed in 2016 by Rajendra Kumar Goel and Bala Yadav. The petitioners had alleged that the developer carried out construction on 200 acres of land without obtaining required clearance and did not make available the open/green area as per the plan, thereby causing immense damage to the environment.

The matter has been listed for further consideration on July 11.

Ajay Pandita, a spokesperson for Ansal Buildwell Ltd, told TOI, ""We didn't receive any notice from the NGT to appear for a hearing. We were completely unaware of it. We can make any further comments only after going through the order carefully.""

The order came after the state authorities failed to take any action against the developer even after a report indicating grave environmental violations was submitted by a high-level committee in the NGT about five months ago. ""It is surprising that in spite of the report submitted about five months back showing violation of law, no action has so far been taken by the statutory authorities, particularly the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB),"" the bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel said in its order, which has been seen by TOI.

CPCB will be entitled to charge interest at the rate of 12% for any delay and to recover the amount by adopting appropriate coercive measures as per the law, the order further stated, adding that the amount is to be spent for restoration of environment.

The report by the committee, which comprises officials from the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC), had found several violations in Sushant Lok III. It had pointed to encroachment in green areas, the lack of groundwater recharge system and sewage treatment plant, non-functional rainwater harvesting pits, and non-maintenance of roads, footpaths and parks. It had further said the builders had failed to obtain clearance from HSPCB and a no-objection certificate from Central Ground Water Authority for extracting of groundwater, and flouted norms to install and operate DG sets.

The tribunal has asked the committee to assess the cost of restoration so that the total compensation which the developer will need to pay can be decided. The panel will give its assessment within three months.

The tribunal also instructed HSPCB to take appropriate action, including prosecution, recovery of damages, installation of rainwater harvesting system and closing swimming pools operating illegally.

The green court has directed the builders to also deposit a performance guarantee of Rs 5 crore and comply with the norms within three months. In case of default, the amount will stand forfeited.

""The order finally brings in the central bodies (CPCB and MoEFCC) to ensure compliance of the environmental norms. Earlier, state boards were in charge and they were hand in glove with the developer. Now it should be noted that Rs 10 crore is an interim compensation and actual cost that the developer has to pay to restore the damage is in hundreds of crores,"" said advocate Yatish Goel.

Last year, the NGT imposed a fine of Rs 195 crore on Goel Ganga Developers for causing damage with its projects in Pune.",2019-03-29T04:09:00Z
The Hindu,India could save trillions in healthcare costs if Paris climate goals are met: Global Environmental Outlook,,"India could save at least $3 trillion (₹210 trillion approx.) in healthcare costs if it implemented policy initiatives consistent with ensuring that the globe didn't heat up beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius by the turn of the century, says the sixth edition of the Global Environmental Outlook (GEO), prepared by the United Nations Environment Programme.

""Damage to the planet is so dire that people's health will be increasingly threatened unless urgent action is taken....Unless environmental protections were drastically scaled up, cities and regions in Asia, the Middle East and Africa could see millions of premature deaths by mid-century,"" a press statement accompanying the report noted.

India's stated commitment is to lower emissions intensity of its GDP by 33-35% compared to 2005 levels by 2030; increase total cumulative electricity generation from fossil free energy sources to 40% by 2030, and create additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tons through additional forest and tree cover.

India is on track to achieve two of these goals -- of emissions intensity and electricity generation -- according to independent climate-watch site Climate Tracker.

However these actions are only enough -- and provided other countries too live up to their commitments -- to limit temperature rise to 2 degrees.

For India to leapfrog onto a 1.5-degree pathway it would have to ""abandon plans to build new coal-fired power plants,"" said Climate Tracker's most updated analysis as of Dec 2018.

The landmark Paris Agreement of 2015 aims to keeping a global temperature rise this century well to ""...below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius.""

However there has been limited progress by countries since then in committing to greenhouse gas emissions cut since then.

Currently environmental ministers and delegates from around the world are participating in a UN conference in Nairobi to discuss issues such as stopping food waste, promoting the spread of electric mobility, and tackling the crisis of plastic pollution.

The GEO report, made public Wednesday, for its assessment on health benefits to India relied on a modelling study by group of scientists and published by Lancet Planetary Health in March 2018.

The report advises adopting less-meat intensive diets, and reducing food waste in both developed and developing countries, would reduce the need to increase food production by 50% to feed the projected 9-10 billion people on the planet in 2050. At present, 33% of global edible food is wasted, and 56% of waste happens in industrialised countries.",2019-03-13T19:00:00Z
The Times of India,70 Punjab industries threaten aquatic biodiversity of three rivers - Times of India,Manish Sirhindi,"PATIALA: The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) report has found that 70 heavy industries in Punjab are threatening the aquatic biodiversity of Satluj, Beas and Ghaggar rivers.

The report, which has been put up before the National Green Tribunal, states that there are 1,735 industrial units in Punjab which require effluent treatment plants (ETPs). Out of these, 1,665 industrial plants have some kind of treatment plant. As per records, the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) had ordered the closure of 40 industries found releasing effluents in the river systems, while 10 industries have been served with showcause notices and action is yet to be taken against 20 units.

Even from among the 1,665 units with ETPs, only 1579 units comply with effluent standards, while 86 plants have been found to be lacking, suggesting that effluents from these were also draining into the river systems. Of these 86 units, four have been asked to shut down, while court cases have been filed against five units. The PPCB has served notices on 49, while the rest continue to operate, showing no concern for the state's rivers.

According to official records, Punjab has only four common effluent treatment plants (CETPs) and of these only three are functional while the fourth, in a legal wrangle, cannot be run. The CPCB has also found the state to be lacking while treating the sewerage waste being generated in the urban and suburban areas. The report found that of the 641 sewage treatment plants (STPs) in the state, only 570 meet the standards. Seventy-one STPs are non-complying and show-cause notice has been served against 17. In a positive development, 120 additional STPs will be operational in the state by March 2020 and four under-construction CETPs would be running next month.

After the NGT took up the matter on August 3, 2018, it had ordered continuous monitoring of effluents being flushed into rivers and asked the CPCB to prepare an action plan after looking into the status of CETPs/ETPs/ STPs and evolve a mechanism to ensure compliance standards.

It had also ordered that a representative of the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change should be associated with the monitoring committee and directed the CPCB to hold monthly review meetings. It had asked the CPCB to take penal action against those accountable for setting up and maintaining STPs, CETPs and ETPs and to recover compensation for damage to the environment and furnish a compliance report before the NGT every four months.

While, the monitoring committee has held its sixth meeting and recently filed a compliance report with the NGT, it is yet to decide on assessing penalty and environmental compensation and action plan to utilize the fund.",2019-02-10T05:55:00Z
The Hindu,Malabar Coffee: Cheers for ryots,E.M. Manoj,"The Wayanad Coffee Growers Association (WCGA) has welcomed the budgetary provisions for supporting coffee farmers in Wayanad district, a major Robusta coffee growing area in the country.

Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac in his budget speech on Thursday said that the government would execute a scheme for doubling the income of people of Wayanad, who were reeling under an agrarian crisis . The farmers were getting only 10% of the retail price of coffee powder and and it would be raised to at least 20% under the scheme, Dr. Isaac said.

The project aims at selling coffee powder of Wayanad under the brand name 'Malabar'.

A three-phase intervention is envisaged for the purpose, including setting up a KINFRA mega food park at ₹150 crore with KIIFB funding in the first phase. Common processing facilities for coffee will be established as a part of it.

Coffee plantations will be categorised, taking into account aspects of local agrarian climate. Scientific care will be ensured during this second phase.

Based on this categorisation tag, the products should be taken to local procurement centres.

The responsibility for this would be with agricultural cooperatives and producer companies. Ripened coffee bean will be procured from the farmers. At the time of procurement of coffee bean itself, a price ranging from 25-100% above the market rate will be transferred to the account of the farmers.

Thirdly, the coffee cultivated in the carbon-neutral Wayanad hills, will be the most-important speciality of global branding of 'Malabar Coffee,' as per the budget document.

WCGA president Prasanth Rajesh told The Hindu that they welcomed the scheme as it would be a long-term welfare measure for farmers.

""Such a move would be a great solace to the farming community at a time when they are reeling under a crisis owing to the declining price of coffee in the open market and low production due to climate change,"" Mr. Rajesh said.

""In spite of many promises made by government agencies, the coffee farmers are still in distress,"" Mr. Rajesh said, adding that if the scheme would be executed in a time-bound manner, it would provide a great solace to the community.

""Direct financial assistance to farmers such as waiving of interest on farm loans is the only means to help the distressed farming community in Wayanad after the deluge,"" said M.

The Times of India,NGT puts brakes on mining near Sariska Tiger Reserve - Times of India,,"JAIPUR: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed all mining activities in the eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) of the Sariska Tiger Reserve (STR) to be stopped immediately till mining leases are cleared by the standing committee of the National Board of Wildlife (NBWL).

With this no mining activity can be carried out within the 10 km radius of STR. The order was issued on December 20 when the NGT was hearing an appeal challenging environmental clearance granted to 24 mining projects within 10 km radius of the reserve's boundary.

The tribunal order reads, ""It is admitted position that the final notification of Eco-sensitive zone for Sariska Tiger Reserve/ Sanctuary is yet to be issued by the MoEF. We therefore, direct that all mining activities of any mineral will be stopped within 10 kms of the boundary till mining leases are cleared by the standing committee of the National Board of Wildlife,""

As per rules, state governments are required to send a proposal for declaring an area as ESZ and once it is accepted by the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change, it gets notified. Generally, an ESZ varies from place to place. As far as STR is concerned, a 10-km radius is treated as the ESZ since Rajasthan government has not forwarded any actual proposal for approval. The order adds, ""In case , MoEF issues final notification on Eco-sensitive Zone, the mining lease which falls in the Eco-sensitive zone will have to have clearance of the standing committee of the NBWL.""

Following the apex court order, the Union environment ministry had also stipulated in their memorandum dated December 2, 2009 that all cases where environmental clearance had been given to mining projects around national parks be placed before the Standing Committee of the NBWL for evaluation.

A forest official informed TOI, under Section 5C of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, NBWL has been vested with the authority to conserve and develop biodiversity by taking appropriate measures.

The Times of India,"Stop farmers from burning crop stubble, says Nitish Kumar - Times of India",,"PATNA: Chief minister (CM) Nitish Kumar, who chaired the third phase of the fifth meeting of the governing body of Bihar Vikas Mission (BVM) on Thursday, issued several directives to curb air and noise pollution in the state.

The CM asked officials of the agriculture department to stop farmers from burning crop stubble. ""Farmers in Nalanda and Patna districts burn crop stubble after harvests, thereby aggravating air pollution. This practice should be stopped at any cost. Air pollution scenario has worsened in Delhi due to burning of crop stubble by farmers in Punjab and Haryana. A campaign should be started in the state to spread awareness on the issue,"" Nitish said.

Three major cities of state - Patna, Muzaffarpur and Gaya - are facing high level of air pollution. Even on Thursday, the air quality index (AQI) of Patna was measured at 394, putting it into 'very poor' category. According to the Central Pollution Control Board, severe air quality can lead to respiratory illness on prolonged exposure.

The CM also asked the principal secretary of agriculture department to spread awareness among farmers to make changes in the crop cycle as per changing climatic conditions.

Speaking on the issue of noise pollution, Nitish asked officials of the forests, environment and climate change department to ensure removal of hooters and siren from all vehicles, except ambulances.

""People often honk horns of their vehicles unnecessarily. The transport department should initiate steps to prevent needless honking,"" the CM said.

The CM asked officials of the animal husbandry and fisheries department to promote use of cow dung and urine for organic farming. He told the officials to shift stray cattle to cow shelters.

The CM also asked the officials of the cooperative department to set up cooperative societies for preventing vegetables from getting wasted.",2018-12-14T02:00:00Z
The Times of India,Plant 15 saplings for each tree cut for hospital: NGT - Times of India,,"NOIDA: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed the Noida Authority to plant 1,500 saplings against 100 trees that had to be felled to construct a parking lot for an upcoming private hospital owned by Union minister and local MP Mahesh Sharma in Sector 71.

Environmentalists had raised objections against the site where the parking lot is supposed to come up, saying it falls in a green belt as marked in the Noida Masterplan of 2017. Though the main hospital building is being constructed on land marked for utility and facility, at least 100 fully grown trees had to be felled to make way for the parking lot.

Though two saplings had been planted against each tree that had to be cut -- the cost of which was borne by the hospital -- the NGT found that none of the plants eventually survived. Though the hospital had denied that it adversely affected the environment, the NGT bench on Friday found ""disturbances"" and ordered the Noida Authority to plant saplings 15 times the number of trees felled. The cost will have to be borne by the hospital.

The hospital is a branch of Kailash Healthcare chain of hospitals, which is owned by the minister of state for environment, forests and climate change, Mahesh Sharma. It has branches in Noida Sector 27, Jewar and Greater Noida. This is the fourth branch of the chain in Gautam Budh Nagar.

""This is not the only example. The Authority has at several places compromised green areas for development work. While Noida braves major pollution issues and depleting ground water, such development work poses high risk to the environment,"" environmentalist Vikrant Tongad, an applicant to the NGT in the case, said.

The green court has asked the Noida Authority to plant 1,500 trees of endemic variety. The hospital has been directed to create three pits for rain water harvesting in way of compensating for the erosion of groundwater caused by the construction of the parking lot. The court has, however, ruled out an appeal to demolish the parking lot. The plantation drive would be supervised by the forest department of Gautam Budh Nagar and the Authority would have to file a report to the principal chief conservator of forests.

Repeated calls to minister Sharma for a reaction went unanswered. The Kailash Hospital authorities also declined comment on the order.

Asked about the NGT order, Rajeev Tyagi, general manager (projects) at the Noida Authority said: ""We will comply with the order of the NGT and with any instruction that has been directed toward us.""",2018-11-17T00:15:00Z
The Times of India,"Rs 3,600 crore to revamp water drainage facilities in 10 Tamil Nadu cities - Times of India",Sivakumar B,"CHENNAI: The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has sanctioned $500 million ( 3,600 crore) to Tamil Nadu, which could help redefine urban living in 10 cities including Chennai and Coimbatore.

The money, part loan and part grant, would be used to improve water supply and sewerage systems, besides reviving rivers and other water bodies. Some four million people were expected to be direct beneficiaries.

The ADB funding includes a technical assistance grant of $1 million to help individuals and organisations build skills to work more efficiently.

To further boost urban transformation initiatives in the identified cities, the Centre, the Tamil Nadu government, the Chennai Metropolitan Water Supply and Sewerage Board, and the urban local bodies concerned would chip in with an additional $766.4 million ( 5,500 cr).

The funding would be spent primarily in areas adjoining industrial clusters of the target cities. A solar-powered sewage treatment plant in Coimbatore, first of its kind in the country, was part of the project, said a statement from the bank's senior urban development specialist Ron Slangen.

The ADB will release the fund in three tranches till March 2022.

ADB to assist city in facing water crisis

The first tranche of $169 million would be for target Chennai, Coimbatore, Rajapalayam, Trichy, Tirunelveli, and Vellore. ""A $2 million grant from the Asian Clean Energy Fund, established by the Government of Japan, will fund the solar energy pilot project,"" said Slangen. ""Managing rapid urbanization is essential for sustaining economic growth and alleviating poverty. The state suffers from recurring droughts and erratic monsoons linked to climate change, resulting in severe water scarcity and urban flooding. ADB's support will help address these challenges through climate-resilient investment and deeper institutional support,"" said Slangen.

In TN, urban service levels remain low. Less than half of the households are served piped water and nearly a third of supplied water gets lost owing to an ageing distribution network. As a result, what residents get is intermittent supply of water for 2 hours a day. Only 42% of households are covered by the sewerage network and 43% of sewage is disposed directly into waterways, untreated. The ADB programme is expected to provide direct assistance in these areas. It seeks to translate the Vision Tamil Nadu 2023 document, released way back in 2012, into action by providing universal access to water and sanitation, all with a view to developing worldclass cities along high-performing industrial corridors, the statement said. ""Beyond physical investments, the programme will boost institutional capacity, public awareness, and urban governance as part of a comprehensive approach for developing livable cities,"" Slangen said.",2018-09-27T03:49:00Z

The Times of India,"Surajpur a wetland, can't allow constructions, says NGT - Times of India",Sharmila Bhowmick,"NOIDA: It's official. Surajpur, a major green lung for Greater Noida, is now a wetland.

The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has granted wetland status to Surajpur, which was earlier termed as a reserved forest. This legal acknowledgement formally brings into effect all wetland conservation and management rules to protect the 60 hectare low-lying area within the 308 hectare reserve forest in Surajpur.

An NGT bench headed by Justice Raghuvendra Singh Rathod and expert member Satyawan Singh Garbyal issued the order on September 14, which was uploaded on Monday. However, the court has still not granted wetland status to six other low-lying areas pointed out in the same petition in 2016 by environomentalists.

Green activists are a happy lot. ""With the formal judicial order of Surajpur as a wetland and the adjoining area as a reserve forest, all ongoing construction work in the premises of the 308 hectare reserve forest needs to come to a halt as the wetland rules will now be in effect in the area,"" Vikrant Tongad, who had moved the NGT in 2016, told TOI.

The Surajpur wetland had become part of an ambitious project by then Akhilesh Yadav government in 2014 when it was included in a 2000 acre eco-park plan to develop eco-tourism in the district. Landscaping and contouring within the massive forest area had started soon after where a roadway construction had been started. Fruit-bearing trees were planted by removing local varieties like keekar. However, Tongad moved the NGT two years back against construction activity in the forest.

Surajpur being a reserve forest, a clearance from the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change was due for any construction. The waterbody within Surajpur was also waiting for a formal declaration as a wetland for it to get protected under the wetland conservation rules.

However, according to the local environmentalists, the construction which interfered with the natural flow of water into the wetland had affected the ecology rendering it dry for over two months during the summer of 2018. The wetland of Surajpur itself is a 60 hectare portion which is a destination for migratory birds from Asia and Europe during the migratory season.

The wetland has been home to 186 species of birds from 44 families of this 102 species are resident, 53 are winter migrants and 28 species are summer migrants.

""Conservation of Surajpur is crucial for the entire region as it is a major green lung. Besides, we must take note of several such low-lying areas which are not recognized or marked but should be recorded as wetlands simply to help conservation activity to take ground,"" Tongad added.",2018-09-18T02:21:00Z
The Times of India,Slow pace of renewables puts question mark on 2022 target - Times of India,Manka Behl,"Nagpur: With just about 7 and 11 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity added in the last two fiscals, the country has a long way to go to meet the Centre's 2022 target of 225GW. For this, it must add nearly 40GW of clean energy every year.

Analysis of latest data available with the Central Electricity Authority (CEA) shows that 20.45% of the total installed capacity of the country is from renewable energy sources. Apart from solar and wind, these also include generation from small hydro projects, biomass, and urban and industrial waste.

Further break down of data brings to the fore that total energy generation from renewables was only 8.08% between July 2017 and June 2018.

The Union power minister RK Singh recently announced the country will achieve the new renewable energy target by March 2022.

Recent reports of ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE) show that the cumulative installed capacity of renewable energy, including grid-connected and off-grid power (till July 2018), is 72.62GW.

For meeting its promised target, around 38GW of renewable installed capacity will have to be added annually for the next four years.

Data mentioned in the 39th report of the standing committee on energy for MNRE shows that in the 2015-16 fiscal, around 7.13GW of new renewable energy capacity was installed. In the next fiscal, it increased to 11.46GW.

According to latest CEA reports, about 12GW was added in the financial year 2017-18 and between April to July this year, another 1.6GW capacity was installed.

The 2022 target not only is too ambitious but it also seems ""unattainable given the current pace of installation"". ""The target looks very far. To meet it, we will have to install nearly 3.5GW of renewable energy every month for the next 44 months. It is a Herculean task,"" says Sunil Dahiya, senior campaigner at Greenpeace India.

To make it happen, the government needs to start thinking on increasing the percentage share of actual electricity generation from renewables rather than just installed capacity-based targets. ""Responding to the urgency to act on climate change and rising pollution, countries across the world have started committing to 100% renewable energy in the near future. To expand the renewable sector, the government should stop building more coal-fired power plants,"" says Dahiya.

As reported by TOI on Wednesday, one-fourth of the country's thermal power plants are running at a plant load factor (PLF) less than 50%.

The Centre not only needs to get aggressive in installation of renewables but also has to focus on promoting decentralized options. ""Rooftop and farm-top solars should be encouraged through attractive schemes,"" adds Dahiya.

However, the ministry's latest report shows installed capacity of solar roof tops is hardly 1.7% of the total renewable capacity (till July 2018). Despite holding great potential, solar installations in the country are plunging (as per reports by a private consulting firm).

One of the major reasons is the safeguard duty imposed on panel imports. It discourages people to go in for installations as the cost goes up.

In states like Maharashtra, anti-solar proposals by distribution company are proving a deterrent. The state government had launched the solar rooftop policy in 2015 to promote green energy. It was getting good response from consumers. This unnerved the state-owned electricity distribution company MSEDCL which, in turn, proposed to levy a surcharge (wheeling charge) at the rate of Rs1.25 per unit. The discom has also proposed to go in for gross metering instead of net.

If the two proposals are accepted by the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC), solar rooftop will become unviable and consumers who have invested lakhs on solar panels will have to face losses.

The latest data with the Maharashtra State Load Dispatch Center reveals that of the state's total energy requirement, not even 1% is met by solar energy. The combined contribution of wind and solar sources is 5.15%.

Of the country's overall installed capacity, solar constitutes only 7%. For a country that has about 300 sunny days every year, solar energy ought to have bright days ahead.

THE HEAT IS ON

India's target: Installing 225GW of renewable energy capacity by March 2022

To meet it: 40GW of renewable energy/year or 3.5GW every month for the next 44 months

Renewable energy installed in last few years: 2015-16: 7.13GW| 2016-17: 11.46GW| 2017-18: 12GW

The Hindu,Scientists to assess biodiversity loss,T. Nandakumar,"The Kerala State Biodiversity Board (KSSB) is setting up a multidisciplinary team of 100 scientists from various research institutes to assist panchayat-level Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs) to carry out a rapid assessment of the biodiversity loss caused by the recent floods in Kerala.

A consultative meeting convened by the KSBB here on Tuesday constituted a core committee to lead the mammoth study, the first of its kind in the State. The format for the assessment has been approved and the core committee comprising 12 scientists has been tasked with preparing a manual of procedure to be given to the BMCs.

KSBB chairman S.C. Joshi said the data collection exercise was expected to be completed by mid-October. ""The information will then be subjected to a detailed analysis to come up with a response plan for restoration of ecological restoration,"" he told The Hindu.

The rapid assessment will cover the damage caused to agricultural biodiversity and rare, endangered and threatened species in diverse ecosystems. It will also study the possible spread of alien invasive species in the wake of the floods and their impact on endemic species. The impact of the floods on the riverine and aquatic ecosystems is another thrust area.

Dr. Joshi said the board had initiated steps to mobilise the BMCs, many of which were dysfunctional. ""Once the manual of procedure for the rapid assessment is finalised, the BMCs will get down to the job with the support of the multidisciplinary team of scientists,"" he said.

The consultation was attended by scientists from government institutions such as the Kerala Forest Research Institute, Jawaharlal Nehru Tropical Botanic Garden and Research Institute, University of Kerala, Kerala Agricultural University, Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute, M.S. Swaminthan Research Foundation, Central Tuber Crops Research Institute, Zoological Survey of India and Institute of Climate Change Studies as well as non-governmental agencies, including the World Wildlife Fund , Centre for Environment and Development, Thanal, and Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment.

The KSBB has drawn up a three- pronged strategy to address the impact of the floods on the ecology and biodiversity of the State. The rapid assessment is to be followed by a chain study to understand how the disaster has affected various ecosystems. The third part of the strategy will focus on developing a long term action plan for ecological restoration.",2018-09-05T13:55:00Z
The Times of India,Govt provides outdated maps at CZMP hearing - Times of India,,"Ahmedabad: The Gujarat Ecology Commission (GEC), Gujarat Pollution Control Board and the forests and environment department of the government of Gujarat jointly organized a public hearing on the state's draft Coastal Zone Management Plan (CZMP) at Dholera on Tuesday. Stakeholders and environment activists protested against exercise and demanded that another hearing be held.

Activists like Rohit Parjapati pointed out that the map shown was from 2011, while the National Green Tribunal had insisted that maps should be updated every five years. ""Villages like Mandvipura which have been wiped out due to the tides are still shown as a revenue village at their old location,"" says Prajapati.

The state government authorities have prepared the CZMP on the basis of the National Green Tribunal (NGT)'s order of November 2017, by which all the states of India are expected to submit their CZMP by April 30, 2018 to the ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC). MoEFCC has to approve the hazard line on the entire coastal area of the states by July 31, 2018.

The activists present at the hearing pointed out that the government authorities accepted that the maps presented for discussion date back to 2011, not reflecting the situation on the ground. Activists added that the maps used by GEC and those provided to members of the public were different, as the latter did not show details such as names of the villages and survey numbers. Despite the guidelines, the state government did not provide information related to the project in the local language, they added.

Prayavaran Mitra member Mahesh Pandya added , ""Our activist members raised objections that physical copies of maps distributed and those available on the website are completely different. Some survey numbers were also not clear. The whole process was poorly conducted,"" says Pandya.

Pradyumnasinh Chudasama, a farmer from Bavaliyari, who was at the hearing, said the hearing ought to be conducted again with better maps and information should be provided to stakeholders so that they can raise their concerns. ""Otherwise the entire exercise will remain a farce,"" he said.",2018-08-08T03:50:00Z
Hindustan Times,"Haryana pollution board report says Bandhwari water safe, experts sceptical",Prayag Arora-Desai,"The Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) has prepared a report on groundwater contamination in the Bandhwari-Mangar region, around 20 km from Gurugram, after samples were collected from five tube wells in the area on July 19. According to the HSPCB, their findings show no cause for alarm.

The report, a copy of which is with Hindustan Times, was filed on the basis of tests conducted on groundwater samples across 17 parameters, which did not detect any presence of contaminants such as oil, grease, iron, nickel, chromium and fluoride. The report also found the level of total dissolved solids (TDS) to be between 380 to 840mg/l (milligrams per litre), and total suspended solids (TSS) to be between 2 to 6mg/l.

The HSPCB report comes over a month after the Hindustan Times ran a report highlighting how groundwater contamination from the Bandhwari landfill is leading to a health scare among the residents of Bandhwari, Mangar, Dera and other villages lying in its vicinity.

Activists, questioned the validity of the report, saying it does not provide any conclusive statement about whether the water is suitable for human consumption.

The HSPCB's findings are also in stark contrast to a CPCB report from 2017, in which the presence of all the above contaminants were detected. The CPCB found TDS levels to be between 19152 to 20452mg/l, while TSS levels were found to be between 1694 to 2070mg/l. The safe limit for TDS is 2100mg/l, according to the CPCB, and the same for TSS varies between 100 to 600 mg/l, depending on the source of the water.

The CPCB report clearly stated that the groundwater near Bandhwari is not suitable for human consumption.

""How could the concentration of these pollutants have dropped so much since 2017?"" questioned environmentalist Vivek Kamboj. Another environmentalist, Vaishali Rana Chandra, wondered why the water samples had not been collected from the same locations as the CPCB had done in 2017. ""If the HSPCB was serious about getting to the bottom of the issue, samples should have been collected from those very same spots,"" she said, pointing out the lack of scientific rigour in the HSPCB's process. The CPCB report tested both surface and groundwater samples from eight sources, including borewells in Mangar, Bandhwari and Dera, as well as three different locations within the landfill itself. This selection covered a greater geographic area than the HSPCB, which collected samples from four borewells in proximity to the Gurugram-Faridabad toll plaza.

One explanation for the apparent decline in contaminant concentration was offered by professor AK Gosain of IIT-Delhi's civil engineering department. ""It might be due to dilution from rainwater,"" Gosain said.

However, Rekha Singh, an approved environment expert from Quality Council of India (Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change), who conducted an independent survey of groundwater quality in Bandhwari in 2015, called the report incomprehensive, saying that it does not provide context and does not make recommendations or concluding statements.

Moreover, the report does not specify whether the contaminants are within the safe limits as per the CPCB's water quality standards. ""One can conclude it as an invalid report which should not be acceptable anywhere,"" Singh said in an email to Hindustan Times.

Jai Bhagwan, the HSPCB's regional officer in Gurugram, was away on official work and could not be contacted for comments. However, sub-divisional officer Dinesh Yadav, who collected the samples on July, responded to claims questioning the report's authenticity, saying, ""We have carried out the testing as per rules. The water is completely safe."" Yadav added that he was not at liberty to divulge any further details.

The 27-acre garbage dump near Bandhwari, managed by Ecogreen Energy, the MCG's concessionaire for waste management in Gurugram, currently exists as an unsanitary landfill, and has reportedly been polluting groundwater through run-off and seepage of leachate, which is released by the mounting untreated waste at the dumping site.",2018-08-03T11:46:00Z

According to a document pasted on the site by ED, plot was provisionally attached on December 9, 2017, on orders of ED's deputy director of Delhi zone office (I). The attachment was confirmed by adjudicating authority on May 28 this year.

The ED also erected a board at site giving details of the attached plot.

The land is owned by LARA Projects LLP which is of Lalu's wife and former CM Rabri Devi and her younger son and former deputy CM Tejashwi Pratap Yadav. The LARA Projects LLP was erstwhile known as Delight Marketing Company Private Limited (DMCL) which was owned by Sarla Gupta, wife of Lalu's close aid and RJD Rajya Sabha MP Premchand Gupta.

Bihar's biggest mall was being developed on the plot by Meridian Construction Private Limited, owned by Lalu's another close aid and MLA Abu Dozana. However, mall's construction was stayed by late union minister (environment, forest and climate change) Anil Dave in May last year for violation of norms.

According to CBI FIR lodged on July 5 last year in the case, the land worth Rs 1.47 crores on documents, was owned by hoteliers Vijay Kochhar and Vinay Kochhar, who had sold it to Sarla firm's on February 25, 2005, against tender for running BNR hotel of Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) at Ranch and Puri.

At that time Lalu was the union railway minister and tendering process were rigged to make Kochhar brother's firm Sujata Hotels Private Limited eligible for bidding of two hotel. Kochhar brothers submitted bid on November 15, 2006 and won it.

It was between 2010 and 2014, the DMLC was transferred by Lalu family when the plot's circle rate was Rs 32.5 crore and market rate was Rs 94 crores.

Lalu, Rabri, Tejashwi, Sarla, the Kochhar brothers, LARA Projects LLP, retired MD (IRCTC) PK Goel and other unknowns were named accused in the CBI FIR.

The Times of India,"NBWL ignores HC order, approves mining in Gir eco-sensitive zone - Times of India",Himanshu Kaushik,"AHMEDABAD: The National Board of Wildlife (NBWL), at its 48th meeting held on March 27, had allowed mining on 417.35 hectares of the eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) of Gir sanctuary -- the last abode of the Asiatic Lion -- despite the Gujarat high court staying issuance of the final notification by the Centre, delineating the area around the sanctuary to be treated as an eco-sensitive zone. The court directed so in April 2017, after a public interest litigation (PIL) challenged the state government's proposal to reduce the area of the ESZ from 3.33 lakh hectares -- as notified by the Ministry of Environment Forest in October 25, 2016 -- to 1.14 lakh hectares.

The minutes of the NBWL meeting, released on April 18, state, ""The standing committee on the proposal was briefed and stated that the project involves the mining of limestone over an area 417.35 hectares -- 414.85 hectares of private revenue land and 2.51 hectares of government wasteland -- at Sugala and Jagatiya villages and are situated at 6.25km from the boundary of Gir Wildlife Sanctuary."" It further says, ""After discussions, the standing committee decided to recommend the proposal along with the conditions and the wildlife mitigation measures stipulated by the state chief wildlife warden (CWLW). The annual compliance certificate on the stipulated conditions should be submitted by the user agency to the state CWLW.""

The ministry of environment forest, climate change, had included 3.33 lakh hectares of area surrounding the Gir Wildlife Sanctuary and National Park comprising 291 villages as eco-sensitive zone. However, the state government in a new proposal sent to the ministry proposed to reduced the area to 1.14 lakh hectares consisting of 191 villages. The division bench of Chief Justice R Subhash Reddy and V M Pancholi, while hearing the PIL challenging the state governments decision, ordered a stay on issuance of final notification and issued notices to the central and state governments.

A senior forest department official said that the boundaries of the proposed ESZ, which was challenged in the HC, is as close to 500 metres from the sanctuary. ""The maximum distance is of four km,"" he added. Gir sanctuary is home to 523 lions, according to the latest census, out of which 168 lions live outside the protected area. More than 300 lions have died in the past five years, of which 25 deaths were unnatural.

According to the official, ""The two villages marked for mining activity -- Sugala and Jagatiya in Kodinar taluka of Junagadh -- were in the list of ESZ villages in the draft notification. However in the revised proposal of the state government, the villages were not included.""

The official said that the permission for mining activity in an area as close as 6km from the sanctuary will be disastrous for the lions as the lions also move outside the sanctuary. He said the CWLW had earlier stated that clearance to any project in the area would be given only after high court order. ""Surprisingly, the authorities decided not to wait for the court directive and gave permission to mining activity in the zone under consideration,"" he said.

The Times of India,APW recommends seismology expert for Lower Subansiri project - Times of India,,"GUWAHATI: Assam Public Works (APW), one of the organizations that have been opposing the construction of the Lower Subansiri Hydropower Project because of environmental and safety concerns, on Tuesday recommended a London-based seismology expert as a member of the independent committee to review the technicalities of the construction of the project.

Sarada Kanta Sarma, emeritus reader in engineering seismology and senior research fellow at Imperial College, London, has been suggested ""only as a recommendation"", APW said.

""With an experience of 37 years, Sarma, a geotechnical engineer, is an expert in seismic hazard assessment of engineering sites, seismic design of earth dams and in the geotechnical aspects of seismic effects in general,"" said Aabhijeet Sharma, president of APW and petitioner before the NGT.

He submitted that the petitioner side would be more than willing to submit two more names to the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change.

In April, the National Green Tribunal had taken up a petition to assess the technicalities of the construction and asked the Centre to set up an expert committee. The directive came after APW complained that the government had violated a previous tribunal order while forming a three-member expert committee.

""As many as nine committees had been constituted to look into the dynamics of the project and not even one committee had reached a holistic conclusion,"" Sharma said. The petitioner had earlier alleged that despite NGT's order to form a committee with accomplished experts and scientists - including individuals or experts from institutions of repute who have undertaken studies on seismology, hydrology of rivers and river ecosystem of the Himalayas and the northeast - the Centre had set up a committee which consisted only of former government employees.

The project, taken up by the National Hydroelectric Power Corporation, is supposed to be the largest hydel power project in the country upon completion. Work has been stalled since December 2011, however, after several local bodies opposed its construction on the grounds that it did not comply with safety norms in the face of a seismic event and the possible impact it could have in the downstream areas of Assam.",2018-05-09T07:01:00Z
The Hindu,Sixth edition of Heat Action Plan (HAP) launched in Ahmedabad,,"Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) in partnership with civil society groups and its partner NGOs on Wednesday launched 6th edition of Heat Action Plan (HAP) to protect city dwellers from climate fueled scorching temperatures.

The 2018 Ahmedabad heat action plan released on Wednesday features several key elements like expanding use of cool roofs, reflective paint on buildings to inside temperatures lower, increasing access to drinking water and training medical professionals to help protects patients during extreme heats.

The civic body has partnered with Gandhinagar-based Indian Institute of Public Health (IIPH) and US based Natural Resources Defence Council (NRDC) along with other groups and NGOs to design and implement the action plan, which was first launched in 2013.

The comprehensive plan has an early warning system used during heat waves, a robust public education campaign about how to avoid harm from excessive heat, inter-agency coordination to alert residents of predicted high temperatures, training for health care professionals to prevent heat-related illnesses and death, and mapping of high-risk areas and communications.

""India is showing the world that in our fight against climate change we can take smart steps right now to protect millions of people from deadly heat waves. AMC's groundbreaking heat action plan helped demonstrate that it's feasible, cost-effective and sensible to create similar heat preparedness plans across Indian cities and states,"" said Sayantan Sarkar of NRDC's India Initiative.

In May of 2010, Ahmedabad suffered a major heat wave as temperatures exceeded 46.8°C, which led to 1,344 additional deaths that month, as compared to the 2009 and 2011 average. That served as a wakeup call that intergovernmental agency action, preparedness, and community outreach was needed to save lives, and prompted creation of its first Heat Action Plan.

""Ahmedabad was the first city to prepare and implement heat action plan, which has now been adopted by 30 cities in 11 states, which face extreme heat waves during summer,"" said Mihir Bhatt of All India Disaster Mitigation Institute (AIDMI), which also works with the civic body in Ahmedabad and many other places.",2018-04-12T05:46:00Z
The Times of India,Technology integration is the way forward for agriculture: Experts - Times of India,,"BENGALURU: From artificial intelligence (AI) to internet of things (IoT), the government hopes to harness a host of technologies, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs/drones), to change the way agriculture is practised. But the lack of a concrete plan that shows ""how to go about it"" means India, and also Karnataka, are still far from making any headway.

""Agriculture contributes only about 10% of the country's GDP despite crores of people involved in the activity. While there have been several interventions through traditional research and new methods introduced in the sector, the need of the hour is to harness new technology and newer systems of agriculture,"" said Maheshwar Rao, secretary, department of agriculture, at the Technology in Agriculture summit on Wednesday. The event was organised by the departments of agriculture and information technology.

Arguing that only modern technology can help in dealing with issues like scarcity of water, climate change and non-availability of input resources, Rao said both the government and the industry need to look at using IoT, AI, advances in GIS, biotech and computing to come up with the most suitable and localised solutions.

Speakers, while acknowledging that dependence on rain -- 65% of the lands in Karnataka are rain-fed -- is a major challenge, also spoke on different kinds of irrigation. Dana Kursh, consul-general of Israel to South India, said: ""If you look at flood irrigation, only 30-50% water is used efficiently, while the same is somewhere between 70-84% in sprinkler irrigation methods. Micro-irrigation, which was invented in Israel, has 90-95% water-use efficiency, which has allowed us to see our desert bloom.""",2018-03-29T03:47:00Z

The directorate said that leaseholders who were granted the second renewal in violation of the decision of the Supreme Court in the Goa Foundation case are given time to manage their affairs and may continue mining till March 15 and then stop all operations till fresh mining leases and environmental clearances are granted.

The directorate also said that all mine owners, agents and managers against whom the verdict is applicable are requested to take suitable safety measures as required under regulation 6, regulation 110, and regulation 115 of the Metalliferous Mines Regulations, 1961, and all other applicable statues as per the provisions of the Mines Act, 1952.

Meanwhile, the mines department has said that all leaseholders have been instructed to remove all movable machinery from their lease areas by 1pm on March 15 unless otherwise directed by the office of the regional controller of mines or the regional office of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC), Bengaluru, both of which are final authorities concerning mining operations in accordance with provisions of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, and rules.

The mines director said that from 1pm on March 15, the leases shall be inspected by technical staff of the state mines directorate either independently or together with officials of the Indian Bureau of Mines, directorate of mines safety, forest department, MoEFCC, Goa State State Pollution Control Board, and other bodies.

Recently, the Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) had decided not to grant consent to operate for the extraction of iron ore that has been redistributed by the mines department. As mining activities were supposed to come to standstill, the directorate of mines and geology had redistributed the extraction limit among operational mines to achieve the 20 MT cap before March 15.

MPT chief engineer L A Mathew, in a letter to GSPCB, said that the port has submitted all details and clarifications as requested by the board, yet the letter to the district collector has not yet been issued. Mathew hence asked the board to write to the district collector (South Goa) to propose a suitable date for the public hearing as prescribed in the environment impact assessment notification, 2006.

The fishing jetty has strongly been objected to by the fishing community. While the passenger jetty has been planned for passenger vessels on routes from Vasco, GSPCB had sought a clarification from the MPT before the public hearing on 'multipurpose cargo', as it is too generic a term and would create confusion during the consultation process.

For the grant of environmental clearance (EC) for the proposed projects, the GSPCB had directed the MPT to submit 20 additional hard and soft copies of the draft environmental impact assessment (EIA) report, including the summary report in English and Konkani, along with 20 copies of form I as submitted by them to the ministry of environment, forest, and climate change (MoEFCC). Further, the MPT was informed that the process of public hearing would only be initiated upon receipt of the documents, after which the date and tentative venue for the hearing would be communicated.

The GSPCB also asked the MPT to clarify whether the proposed modernization and expansion of port infrastructure is a single project of the MPT, as it appears that there are several projects or expansion initiatives proposed within the port area. The MPT then sent a letter to the board with two demand drafts of Rs 15 lakh for organizing the public hearing.",2018-02-24T22:32:00Z
The Times of India,"UN lab in Gurugram, to focus on women entrepreneurs - Times of India",Shubhra Pant,"GURUGRAM: The city is set to get a United Nations (UN) technology innovation laboratory which will work on promoting women entrepreneurship in the region. An MoU was signed between the state government IT department and UN to build the laboratory at the Haryana State Electronics Development Corporation campus in Udyog Vihar 1.

Now, the UN team is working on internal clearances and the laboratory is expected to start operations in 2018. ""The UN innovation lab will focus on promotion of women entrepreneurs in the state and research in this regard would be done under two sub-heads -- creating an ecosystem to support local women innovators and investing in technology startups by women,"" said a senior official from the Haryana IT department.

He added that the scope of the lab, however, would not be restricted to women entrepreneurship only. It will work as a resource centre for delivery of and training for new innovation and technology tools to benefit all the UN member states.

""The lab will help to develop tech-based pilot programmes to address various concerns of regions and countries and build information communication technology for meeting UN's sustainable development goals,"" said the official.

A few of the sustainable development goals enlisted for the Gurgaon lab include providing food security, developing sustainable agriculture practices, catering to health and well-being of all age groups, building safe, resilient and substantial cities and human settlements, combating climate change and its impacts, and building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels to promote peaceful and inclusive societies.

It will also help to support the Aadhaar project in the state of Haryana. Two more such laboratories have been proposed in Kerala and Chattisgarh.

The upcoming project in Haryana has recently found mention in the department of industrial policy and promotion's collection of best practices being followed by different states for supporting startups. It has been mentioned in a booklet released last week.

The state government is, also, in the process of setting up a centre for Internet of Things in the same campus and a global start-up village is on the cards, too.

The Times of India,'No pollution due to excess handling' - Times of India,Murari Shetye,"Panaji: South West Port Limited (SWPL) unit of JSW denied that there is any air pollution in the port town of Vasco due to excess handling of coal by the firm at Mormugao Port Trust. SWPL said that if Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) revokes its consent to operate, then it will cause deficit of steel in the market.

The company has requested the board for a ""grace period"" of four weeks before passing any order against the coal handling plant.

On November 30, GSPCB had issued a show cause notice to SWPL for handling an excess amount of 5.987 million metric tonnes per annum of coal. SWPL has been asked to explain why their consent to operate should not be revoked.

""We state that while the alleged show cause notice is issued on the premise that SWPL is exceeding the limit to handle coking coal/coke as against the limits granted, SWPL has adequate pollution control measures to prevent/avoid any pollution and the readings establish that our operations are well within prescribed permissible limits of pollution,"" unit head, SWPL, said in its reply to GSPCB's notice.

""We state that it is fundamental to establish that our operations are causing pollution beyond the permissible prescribed limit of pollution and not merely on the basis that the output is beyond the permitted capacity,"" SWPL said, adding that ""any operations carried out beyond the purported permissible limits of handling coking coal/coke does not ipso facto determine that the same is causing pollution beyond the prescribed permissible pollution limit.""

SWPL submitted that its operations at berth no 5A and 6A has neither caused any air pollution or water pollution, and hasn't committed a breach of any of the provisions of the Air Act or Water Act or any rules framed thereunder.

""We further elucidate that substantial cargo of SWPL is handled directly without discharging or offloading at the berths/stockyard. Thus, the said cargo is transported/conveyed from the mother vessels by way of closed conveyor belts to the railway wagons as against the handling at berths/stockyard,"" SWPL said.

SWPL said that it is pertinent to note that carrying capacity of the MPT as can be seen from the letter dated October 30, 2013, of the ministry of environmental, forest and climate change, granting environmental clearance is 50 million metric tonnes per annum, and in the least, can be said to be 25 million metric tonnes per annum.

""Any adverse order of revocation/suspension of the consent to operate would not only cause grave and irreparable loss, harm and injury to SWPL, but would also have adverse repercussions on the steel industry, causing a deficit to steel in the market,"" SWPL said.

SWPL has been operating at MPT for more than a decade now with a strength of over 100 direct employees and around 350 or more indirect employees associated with various contractors, of which more than 60% are local residents.",2017-12-30T22:36:00Z
The Times of India,London Mayor says UK govt's visa norms a big mistake - Times of India,,"Mumbai, Dec 3 () London Mayor Sadiq Khan today said he was ""lobbying"" with the British government to change its stringent visa norms, which he termed as a ""big mistake"".

Khan arrived in the country's commercial capital as part of his first official tour to three Indian cities, others being Delhi and Amritsar, to strengthen the UK capital's trade ties.

""I am a big critic of the British government over the change in the Visa policy. I think they have made a big mistake, as on one hand the British government is asking Indian businesses to trade there and on the other hand they have made it more hard (to enter the country),"" Khan said during his interaction with reporters.

Recently, the Theresa May government changed its visa policy for non-EU (European Union) nationals to curb its soaring immigration figures. The policy which came into effect in November will affect a large number of Indians, especially IT professionals.

""I want to assure you that I am lobbying with my government to change its immigration stance, because I want talented Indians to come to London and not go to Canada, Australia or the US. London is open to people, talent and partnership,"" the London Mayor said.

India last month flagged its serious concerns to Britain over its stringent visa norms and hike in threshold limit of annual pay of working professionals to get the travel documents.

Khan said the change in UK's current position on immigration is needed in the interest of the UK capital.

""One of the reasons why London is the greatest city in the world is its ability to catch talent. (A total of) 40 per cent of Londoners are from outside the UK. IT's in the interest of London to change its stance on immigration and I'm optimistic that it will change in near future,"" he said.

The visiting Mayor also underlined the need to forge strong cultural ties with India, particularly with Mumbai.

""I believe that culture is the DNA of any city. I'm meeting (Maharashtra) Chief Minister tomorrow and hoping to announce a lot of things in relation to culture as well as a joint venture on issues like ecology and climate change,"" he said.

Hailing Bollywood, Khan said they wanted to learn how the industry can churn out so many movies in a year.

""One thing that we are doing in Mumbai is learning how you mange to make so many films in Bollywood..what is that you are doing? Indian films' post-production work is excellent. Hollywood filmmakers come here to do their post production work. So, one of the announcements we are making tomorrow will be of the UK and India making films together, which will be a good example,"" he said.

Khan said students will benefit a lot as professionals after they get education in the top universities in London.

""There are more international students in London than any other city in the world. Four of the world's top 30 universities are in London. Due to the change in the visa policy, some Indian students chose to go to Canada or Australia. ""However, I want to tell Indian students that our universities are brilliant. When you come to London, apart from fantastic quality of education you get, you also get the experience and the contacts you make...This will stand you in good head when you return to (your) country as executive, investor, teacher or entrepreneur,"" he said.

The Times of India,Manali villagers to challenge Rohtang ropeway project in SC - Times of India,Suresh Sharma,"Manali: A day after the National Green Tribunal (NGT) directed the Himachal government to expedite the Rohtang ropeway project, residents of nine villages in the foothills of Rohtang and other stakeholders, on Tuesday, decided to challenge the project in the Supreme Court.

The villagers, who believe that this project would affect their livelihood, had called an emergency meeting at Kothi village, where the ropeway is proposed to be built. The villagers, taxi operators, representatives of many tourism-based unions and organizations, decided that they would not let the ropeway to be established in Rohtang at any cost and for this they would knock the door of the highest court.

The villagers said they were being duped and the project was being forced upon them without their will.

""We shall move to the SC as soon as possible. We are not against development but development should not be at the cost of the environment, livelihood of the locals and to benefit just one company,"" said Nau Gaon Committee president Roshan Thakur.

The villagers had presented local issues and problems before the NGT which have been ignored while giving the judgment to establish the ropeway, he alleged. ""None of our issues has been addressed. We have been disappointed. Not a single person is happy,"" said Thakur.

The villagers present in the meeting said, the only power not to issue the NOC through the panchayat to express their resentment towards the project, has been snatched away from them as the project has been declared a linear project where the ministry of environment, forest and climate change has bypassed their power.

The taxi operators also expressed concern over their livelihood options which they believe would be destroyed by the project. The local taxi union president Raj Kumar Dogra said they would support villagers in taking the matter to the SC.

The villagers said they had read the MoU signed between the project management and the government and found that the conditions were completely unfavourable towards them. They said it was strange that no representative from the project came to settle the issue. ""The SC is the last and the only hope for us,"" they said.

The multi-crore Rohtang ropeway will be spread over nearly 9km. Starting from Kothi at about 8,000ft, the ropeway will take passengers to Rohtang pass at 13,050ft. The ropeway will have four boarding points at Kothi, Gulaba, Marhi and Rohtang.

The NGT has asked the state government to expedite the project in an effort to decrease traffic congestion between Manali and Rohtang, which in return will decrease the carbon emissions.

When Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump shake hands and perhaps embrace each other next week, the mandatory encomiums about India and U.S. being the world's largest and oldest democracies, respectively, would have a sombre undertone to them. Both these democracies are passing through testing times.

Powerful political forces are trying to re-litigate principles that have held for decades in India, and have evolved over centuries in America. This ongoing re-litigation involves, at the functional level, some fundamental questions about citizenship, individual and collective rights, particularly religious rights, the terms of engagement between the state and citizens, the balance of power between various branches of the government, the role of the media, etc. At the conceptual level, what is being debated is the question of national identity itself. As recurring incidents show in both countries, this process is oftentimes violent, and not based on a commonly agreed set of facts. And facts are being invented and misrepresented, including in cases where historical records and scientific evidence do not leave any such scope. This internal debate on democracy is also testing the resilience of institutional checks and balances, the bedrock of both democracies. While both India and the U.S are pondering over the values that define them as nations, talking of shared values -- the bond between the two countries -- may sound incongruous.

The other shared bond is of interests. America is deeply divided on what its national interests are. It is unable to decide who are its friends and who are its enemies. Indian commentators have over the years admired America for its single-minded pursuit of its strategic culture, its ability and willingness to use military power to change the course of world politics. But the Trump movement is based on a public repudiation of this strategic culture. The President has repeatedly called out the country's war planners and strategic thinkers. It is not that he is offering any alternative thinking; in fact, his actions are contradicting his own stated positions on so many fronts. He believes that championing a new era of military build-up is essential for making America great again, though he has called American interventions in recent decades ""stupid"". It is unlikely that America's strategic behaviour would change dramatically, but the fact remains that it now has a President who believes that what America has been pursuing all this while is not its national interest.

Resisting Chinese expansionism has been a shared interest between India and the U.S in recent years, and the rising defence cooperation between the two countries is testimony to that. But the American attitude to China, and the way it sees India in that equation, is more nuanced than the linear notion prevalent in India. In the order of American threat perceptions, China appears to be quite low at the moment, with Russia climbing to the top as a conventional threat -- yet another point on which the security establishment and the President are not on the same page. Islamism and the potential for nuclear adventurism by North Korea or Iran come much higher on the list than China.

China is not a military threat to the American mainland unlike Russia, which has the capability even if not the intent. Economic ties are no guarantee against conflict, strategic commentators have argued citing pre-World War trade links among European countries. But U.S.-China economic links are of a different nature qualitatively. American companies fume about unfair state interventions and IPR (intellectual property rights) losses in China, but the Chinese market and manufacturing processes are essential for their global operations. For the American state, China, as a threat, comes in the category of 'important, but not urgent'. Moreover, China is a valuable partner dealing with some more urgent questions. During the Obama years, they were climate change and North Korea. Under Mr. Trump, the single-minded focus is on dealing with North Korea. Mr. Trump also hopes for Chinese cooperation in his plans for the America economy. His administration has taken a benign view of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative while American companies are trying to get as much business out of it as possible.

India has complained of American lack of sympathy for its concerns in its policy towards Pakistan. There has been increasing appreciation among Washington's strategic thinkers and policymakers of Pakistan's duplicity in the conflict in Afghanistan. That Pakistan exports terror to its neighbouring countries has now been stated in multiple government documents and Congressional hearings. However, successive U.S. administrations have viewed India's attempts to influence America's Pakistan policy with scepticism. While India wants the U.S. to rein in Pakistan's sponsorship of terrorism, it does not want American opinion on Kashmir -- a position that American policymakers consider contradictory. While Americans increasingly appreciate the fact that India has been a victim of Pakistani aggression, they also believe New Delhi could be more appreciative and supportive of American efforts to stabilise the region. Stabilising Pakistan and seeking a political deal with the Taliban have been part of that approach.

Previous administrations would be more guarded in expressing such concerns with India, which may not be case with Mr. Trump. Already, by offering to negotiate between India and Pakistan, the U.S. Ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, has stirred up a hornet's nest in India.

While it will take continuous engagement for India and the U.S. to explore their shared interests in Asia-Pacific and Af-Pak, any misalignment between the U.S. State Department and the Pentagon is no good news for India. Mr. Trump has cut the budget for the former while committing more money to defence, and the White House has declared that the new administration believes in hard power, not soft. The Pentagon sees each bilateral relationship from a military planning perspective while the State Department places it in a broader strategic calculation. Consequently, the U.S. Department of Defense has been a champion of enhancing cooperation with India, and its initiatives often do not pass muster with the Department of State. For instance, the Pentagon supports the sale of Guardian drones to India, while the State Department has raised the red flag that the technology has been given only to South Korea, a treaty ally of the U.S., so far in the region. Resolution of such intra-government disputes can only be achieved by a strong-willed political leadership committed to ties with India.

The India-U.S. partnership has inherent reasons to survive. But the romanticism that characterised the hype of well-meaning advocates of a stronger partnership needs to be tempered with a dose of realism. The heady romance is taking a pause, but the companionship will endure, loveless as it could be.",2017-06-21T18:50:00Z
The Times of India,Environmental studies now a must at UG level - Times of India,,"HYDERABAD: Under-graduate (UG) students in Telangana will have to pursue a six-month course in environmental studies as the University Grants Commission (UGC) has made it mandatory for all higher educational institutions to offer the course.

The UGC issued a circular on Monday to all institutions regarding compulsory implementation of the module syllabus for UG in all universities and colleges. An expert committee framed an eight unit module syllabus for the course, which will be offered to students during the second semester. The module covers topics such as natural resources and associated problems, ecosystems, biodiversity and its conservation among many others.

The first seven units will cover 45 lectures to enhance knowledge skills regarding environment. Unit eight is based on field activities, which will be covered in five lecture hours. As part of the field work, students have to document environmental assets (river/forest/grassland/hill/mountain), visit to a polluted site (urban/rural/industrial/agricultural), and study common plants, insects, birds and simple ecosystems (river, hill etc.)

The exam of 100 marks will be conducted at the end of semester. The question paper will have short answer pattern for 25 marks, essay type with inbuilt choice for 50 marks and field work for 25 marks.

""Degradation of green cover, rise in temperature and climate change has severely damaged the environment. The UGC was of the opinion that awareness about such issues can only be made by making the course mandatory,"" said Prof C Manoharachary of department of Botany, Osmania University, who was a member of the expert committee.

The Times of India,Aarey to hand over 1.8 acres for shifting high tension lines - Times of India,Clara Lewis,"Mumbai: Aarey will hand over 77,500 sq feet (1.8 acres) for shifting high tension lines of Reliance Energy, which will be interfering with track electricification lines for Metro III.

A government resolution for handing over the land to Reliance Energy was issued by the state agriculture, animal husbandry and dairy development departments on Friday. The land will be transferred to the state revenue and forest departments, which will then be handed over to Reliance Energy.

At present, these lines are on the 29.2 hectares (72 acres) handed over to Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (MMRCL) to build the car-shed for Metro III. The land was handed over to MMRCL in August 2014.

Last January, MMRCL, following a public outcry, had proposed a double-deck car-shed reducing land requirement to 20.82 hectares and impacting only 446 trees.

An MMRCL spokesperson said the lines are coming within the area where depot tracks will be laid. ""Track electrification lines conflict with high tension lines and hence need to be shifted,"" said the spokesperson.

In March, MMRCL wrote to the government asking for the high tension lines to be shifted. In fact, the new location, which is across the Marol Maroshi road near a Reliance sub-station was identified by MMRCL. According to a GR issued by the Dairy Development Department, MMRCL has said the 1.8 acres have been excluded from the eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) around Sanjay Gandhi National Park.

In the final ESZ notification issued last December, the Union ministry for environment and forests and climate change had excluded 165 hectares (407 acres) from the ESZ around the national park.

D Stalin, director the Vanashakti NGO that has filed a plea before the National Green Tribunal to declare the whole of Aarey as an ESZ said, ""Aarey is a no-development zone and there is a public hearing which is under way, yet the government in the most undemocratic manner is giving out parcels of land.""

The Times of India,Pollution board starts inspection of mines - Times of India,,"Panaji: The Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) has begun inspecting 30 mining leases, the ore extraction quota of which were recently enhanced by the directorate of mines and geology (DMG). Following this, it will take a decision on granting consent to operate under the augmented extraction quota.

A senior GSPCB officer said owners of the 30 mining leases approached the board after their mining plans were approved by the Indian Bureau of Mines (IBM), adding that none can proceed with extracting ore up to the enhanced limit if the board doesn't grant its consent. ""We have visited some of the mines and will start issuing consent to operate certificates,"" the officer said.

The state government recently increased the iron ore extraction quota of 30 mining leases in a bid to augment Goa's revenue from mining exports, which could then be used to pay off pending loans and initiate development works. But it has to first exhaust the cap of 20 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) before it approaches the Supreme Court to increase the extraction limit.

Earlier this week, the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) began seeking comments from a number of state and central departments over increasing the iron ore output cap in Goa. Around 10 central and state government departments were asked for their views on the report prepared by the six-member expert committee appointed by the Supreme Court, which had recommended an extraction limit of 37 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of iron ore in the state.

The Times of India,EESL to set up model units for energy efficiency in Surat's textile cluster - Times of India,,"Surat: Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL), a company under the Union power ministry, has set its eyes on the man-made fabric (MMF) cluster in Surat for setting up energy efficient textile processing units.

The EESL is all set to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with two textile processing units, to be suggested by the South Gujarat Textile Processors Association (SGTPA), for setting up the programmable logic controller (PLC) and the caustic recovery plant at the Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) at Pandesara GIDC.

Official sources said that the project will be undertaken by the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) with support from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) for promoting energy efficiency and renewable energy in Surat's textile cluster in collaboration ministry of MSME (MoMSME) and the ministry of new and renewable energy (MNRE).

A brainstorming workshop on 'promoting market transportation for energy efficiency in Indian MSMEs in Surat's textile cluster' was organised in the city on Tuesday.

Addressing a gathering of textile processors, chief general manager (CGM) of EESL, S P Garnaik said, ""EESL will select two model units for improving production using energy efficient technology in Surat. The project will be launched under the Unido and GEF funded scheme. The main aim is to improve production and save energy. After the success, other units may also join in the project.""

Garnaik added, ""Surat figures under the climate change initiative. Thus, it is high time the textile sectors and other related sectors must think on reducing the carbon emission by using state-of-the-art technology.""

President of SGTPA, Jitu Vakharia added,, ""We have asked EESL to fund the caustic recovery plant at the CEPT in Pandesara. The CETP is unable to process the waste generated from the textile processing units that have turned manufacturing cotton fabrics. Also, the automation of the processing units will help in reducing energy and the carbon emission.""

The Times of India,"Camel population dwindles due to smuggling, diseases - Times of India",Rachna Singh,"Jaipur: Given the current scenario, the camel (Camelus dromedaries), the 'State Animal' of Rajasthan, may soon figure in the IUCN Red List as a critically endangered species.

The Rajasthan Camel (Prohibition of Slaughter and Regulation of Temporary Migration or Export) Act, 2015, which came into effect in 2016, has been of no help as the state government has failed to take any concrete step to either conserve the species or help in its proliferation.

Recently, 66 camels 'smuggled' from Rajasthan were rescued from Chanchal in north Malda of West Bengal and returned to the state.

Four people, hailing from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, were arrested in connection with the camel smuggling, TOI had reported. The camels were brought from Rajasthan to be sold at the 'haat' (village market). Camel trading is common in Bengal, Bihar and UP. Animals taken from Rajasthan are sold in the markets of Itahar, Chanchal, Harishchandrapur, Ratua in West Bengal and some other areas. There is a huge demand for camel meat in Bangladesh as well.

As per the act, illegal transportation of camels, without the permission from a competent authority, is a punishable crime with rigorous imprisonment of between six months and three years and attracts a fine of Rs 5,000 to 25,000.

In an online grievance (MOEAF/E/2016/01211) on Saturday, Naresh Kadyan, animal rights activist, stated, ""The Act has been implemented without any policy, rules and regulations for camel transportation. Till today, no prohibition order has been passed by the Animal Welfare Board of India along with the government of Rajasthan. Camels are being badly abused and slaughtered and their numbers are dwindling by the day.""

While animal husbandry is a major economic activity of the rural people, especially in the arid and semi-arid regions of Rajasthan, the livestock numbers are not very encouraging.

The development of livestock sector has a significant beneficial impact in generating employment and reducing poverty in rural areas. But the 19th Livestock Census of 2012 had registered a sharp decline in camel population in comparison with the 2007 census.

According to the census, the population of camels in the state had fallen from 42,1836 in 2007 to 32,5713 in 2012, registering a drop of 22.79%.

A little further down the years, camel population had witnessed a phenomenal drop of 25.6% in 2003 during the period between 16th and 17th livestock census.

But besides trading in camel meat, mainly to Bangladesh and Gulf countries, the decline can also be attributed to demographic transition and ecosystem disruptions along with climate change. Two main reasons for the decline are the proliferation of diseases and the distorted male-female ratio of camels other than the decrease in grazing and pasture land.

""Till 2008-09, the forest department used to provide grazing land to camels. Later, camels lost forest lands after the species was notified as protected. One camel's food intake is 11-16 kg for optimum nutrition per day. And this can't be supplemented otherwise,"" said Dr Dau Lal Bohra PhD (animal microbiology & wildlife).

Other reasons for the dwindling camel population are rampant morbidity and mortality that even the National Research Centre on Camel (NRCC), Jorbeer, has failed to control. About 40 animals have been found to be infected from the 350 to 400 samples taken for scientific research. The most commonly found disease in camels, trypanosomiasis, which leads to still birth and dystokia, said Bohra.

Speaking after launching GIAN courses here on Monday he said: ""GIAN courses bring together Indian and international scholars to offer joint courses. This facilitates better exchange of academic knowledge and possibilities of collaborative research works in future. More importantly, it gives an opportunity to our students to learn from international experts. It seeks to garner best international experience into our system of education, enable interaction of students and faculty with the best academic and industry experts from across the world and also share their experiences and expertise to motivate people to work on the same lines.""

""Proposals for GIAN courses pass through a rigorous three-stage selection process, and it is competitive. Of about 700 GIAN courses approved for 2016, a large majority is from premier institutions like IITs, IIMs and specialized research institutions like the Indian Institute of Science (IISc). Not many state universities are among them, but UoM is one of the only two conventional universities from the state which have been selected to offer GIAN courses,"" he said.

Professor Rudiger Kiesel, head of Chair for Energy Trading and Financial Services, University Duisburg-Essen, Essen (Germany), along with T S Devaraja, associate professor of commerce, and director of Post-Graduate Centre, University of Mysore, will present a six-day course on 'Quantitative climate finance' from November 28.

Prof Kiesel said: ""At the Paris climate conference (COP21) held in December last year, 195 countries adopted the first-ever universal and legally binding global climate deal. The agreement sets out a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to less than 2 degree Celsius. The European Union has already outlined in its Roadmap 2050 its targets for climate action, and one of these relates to climate and energy. This target includes renewable energy generation and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions as important points. To achieve these targets and switch to a low-carbon economy, a huge financial effort from global and European societies is required.""

""Till now, governments have sponsored projects with regard to climate funds, green loans, and subsidies. In order to meet the targets, private financing for renewable energy and clean development mechanism projects are needed. The course will outline the basic concepts of climate economics and discuss regulatory measures. This apart, we will also investigate the evaluation of renewable energy projects and the role of capital markets in financing them,"" the professor added.

The Times of India,NGT issues notices to 12 mining lease holders - Times of India,,"Panaji: The National Green Tribunal (NGT), on Thursday, issued notices to 12 mining lease holders (holding 24 mining leases), based on an application challenging their operations.

Green NGO, Goa Foundation, along with Shankar Jog, in an application filed before the NGT, raised a query whether the 12 mining lease holders can commence or continue mining operations without a valid environment clearance, in view of the apex court's July 2017 judgement.

The applicants pointed out that the clearances are not valid beyond the period of two years granted under the said clearance. The validity of the clearance beyond the original 2-year validity period has been set aside by the Supreme Court of India

In the said judgement, the Supreme Court had set aside the environment clearance issued to the lease holder (M/s. Talaulikar & Sons Pvt Ltd), on grounds that the procedures laid down under the 1994 EIA notification had not been complied with. It is contented by the applicants, that, factually, the 12 lease holders named as respondents, find themselves in a similar situation.

""In view of the order, the lease holders do not have a valid EC. Hence, no mining can resume on these leases without once again following the procedure established by law reiterated by the Supreme Court,"" the applicants said.

The applicant alleged that the mining carried out on the said leases is illegal. In any event, the respondents cannot mine in the ensuing season without a valid environment clearance, stated the applicants.

The applicants claimed that the ministry of environment, forests and climate change, must initiate the same procedures in the cases of these respondents

""Yet, the ministry of environment, forests and climate change, doesn't appear to take any steps in this direction,"" the applicant alleged.

The Times of India,"Carbon-neutral tag for IGI Airport, first in Asia-Pacific - Times of India",Anvit Srivastava,"New Delhi: The Indira Gandhi International (IGI) airport on Tuesday became the first airport in Asia-Pacific to achieve the carbon neutral status.

The Airports Council International (ACI) announced IGI's achievement during the airport carbon accreditation certificate presentation ceremony in Montreal, Canada.

The same body awarded IGI the world's number one position (in 25-40 million passengers per annum category) twice in a row under the Airport Service Quality (ASQ) programme.

Airport officials said that the airport carbon accreditation has upgraded Delhi Airport to 'Level 3+, Neutrality', which is the highest level of achievement available to airports across the world.

Carbon neutrality occurs when the net carbon emissions over an entire year is zero. This means the airport absorbs or offsets the same amount of emission that is generated, officials added.

The chief executive officer of Delhi International Airport Limited (DIAL), I Prabhakara Rao, said, ""Achievement of the accreditation for carbon neutrality is indeed recognition of a great team work. Today we have delivered on our commitment of achieving sustainable solutions for aviation climate change mitigations made at LPAA-COP 21 last year through carbon neutrality. With this achievement, we have set up a new benchmark for other airports in this region.""

He said that now DIAL is focussing on energy conservation and exploring alternative solution for generating green energy. The Delhi airport further aims to increase its solar power generation capacity to 20MW by 2020, he added.

The various emission saving measures implemented in DIAL have resulted in 51% reduction in specific greenhouse gas (GHG) emission (kgCO2/Pax) during the last five years.

At IGI, DIAL has taken the proactive approach towards environment management and sustainability development. Terminal 3 of Delhi Airport is a LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environment Design) Gold certified green building. Other energy efficient and environment friendly infrastructures at the airport include sewage treatment plant (STP) and water treatment plant (WTP), energy efficient bridge mounted equipment (BMEs), energy efficient lighting systems, advanced fuel hydrant systems, fixed electric ground power units (FEGP) and preconditioned air (PCA) supply systems.

ACI Asia-Pacific regional director Patti Chau said, ""We are extremely delighted to welcome the first airport in our region with such achievement.We are proud of Delhi airport's achievement and its commitment to sustainability which has set a good example for airports in the region.""",2016-09-27T20:04:00Z

""Due to water crisis in the Gulf countries they have to import all their food items which leaves them worried about an ever increasing population. Can't we keep the requirements of Gulf in the mind and fulfil them through export,"" the Prime Minister said at Vigyan Bhawan here, marking the platinum jubilee function of the CSIR.

He said at the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) function that there's a huge demand of agricultural products in the Gulf and Indian farmers could provide them a cheaper alternative to capture that market.

""Scientists should focus on developing new varieties. We should not be limited to production and consumption locally but also focus on export,"" Modi said, adding that the country is proud of its scientists.

Saying that no nation could progress without scientific innovation, the Prime Minster called for a ""talent hunt"" for the scientists, innovators and entrepreneurs.

""Just like the reality shows go on talent hunt and come up with best talents of the country, a similar talent hunt is required for the scientists and innovators,"" Modi said.

On the occasion a number of scientists were awarded for their contribution. The Prime Minister asked the awardees to adopt schools and groom a few chosen students to become future scientists.

Modi highlighted the CSIR's 75 years as a ""journey dedicated to nation"".

He expressed his gratitude to the CSIR for the range of domains where the institute has left an ""indelible mark"".

""From agriculture to aerospace, chemicals to climate change, drug development to deep sea explorations... from health to housing, from UAV's (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) to underwater vehicles CSIR has registered its presence,"" Modi alliterated.

""Sometimes I think that I have very high expectations from you... but one asks from only those who can deliver,"" he said. Union Minister for Earth Science Dr Harsh Vardhan also praised the efforts of nation's scientists.

Calling for technology intervention in waste management, Modi said, ""we can turn waste to wealth through technology ... Their is a huge opportunity to grab in that sector, which would not just generate businesses but also keep the nation clean"".

The Prime Minister also dedicated seven new indigenously developed varieties of plants to the nation and interacted with the farmers through videoconferencing.

Modi interacted with the farmers from Hyderabad, Jammu, Cuddalor (Tamil Nadu), Jorhat (Assam) and Palampur (Himachal Pradesh).

The new varieties of the plants that have ornamental and medicinal qualities were developed by the CSIR laboratories, especially Central Institute of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants (CIMAP).

The plants include new varieties of lemongrass, citronella, vetiver and canna lily plant.

Established in 1942, CSIR is a leading autonomous body and India's largest research and development organisation. With a network of 38 laboratories, CSIR has about 3,500 scientists and 3,000 technical personnel.

The Times of India,Outfit seeks release of Salem activist - Times of India,,"Coimbatore: The People's Union of Civil Liberties (PUCL) has demanded the state government to release environmental activist Piyush Manush, who was arrested on July 8 by Salem police.

Piyush Manush, convenor of Salem Citizen's Forum (SCF), and two other activists, Eesan Karthik and Muthu, were arrested for protesting against the construction of the Muluvadi gate overbridge in Salem, allegedly without giving prior notice to the locals and without laying an alternate road.

The activists were booked under four counts of IPC including wrongful restraint, assault or criminal force to deter a government servant from discharging official duty and criminal intimidation. Some of these sections are non - bailable.

""PUCL condemns this arbitrary and high handed action of the police. It is nothing but an intimidation and suppression of democratic rights. The police action is a clear violation of human rights,'' said a statement from S Balamurugan, general secetary of PUCL, Tamil Nadu.

Balamurugan said that Piyush has done commendable work in the field of environmental protection and climate change mitigation and has led Salem Citizens Forum to revive many water bodies in Salem city like Mukaneri, Ammapettai eri Kundukkal eri, Ismailkhan eri, Arisipalayam Theppakulam and Pallappatti well.

""He created a cooperative forest in Dharmpuri extending up to 150 acres, with the support of his friends and well wishers. This mountain forest acts as a water catchment area for Ettimarathupatti Canal which supplies irrigation water to 17 villages in the vicinity,'' Balamurugan said.",2016-07-15T07:23:00Z
The Times of India,Javadekar gets a promotion for cutting green tape - Times of India,,"NEW DELHI: New human resources development (HRD) minister Prakash Javadekar, the only minister of state to be elevated to Cabinet rank on Tuesday, was in Berlin on an official assignment when he got a call asking him to be present here well in time for the oath-taking ceremony that was to be the high point of his political career so far.

Javadekar has been used to bending deadlines and delivering on key priorities since he took charge as junior minister for environment and forests promising to end the rent-seeking that marked the ministry's functioning. He annoyed some activists who felt that he was brushing aside guidelines, but he managed to reduce the infamous green tape through time-bound clearances and direct 24x7 measurements of polluting industries through an online system.

Since there was no direct flight from Berlin to New Delhi when he got the message, his office in coordination with the Indian embassy arranged shorter flight via Abu Dhabi so that he could reach by early Tuesday morning. He landed here at 3am. He was in Germany for attending the seventh St. Petersburg Climate Dialogue.

Not too long after he was inducted into the council of ministers, Javadekar had lost the charge of two key departments of information and broadcasting and parliamentary affairs in November 2014. But since then he got down to handling the environment and forests and climate change briefs with single minded dedication and a reduction in the backlog of stalled projects would have pleased PM Narendra Modi who reached him in Berlin.

A number of measures taken by his ministry under his leadership appear to have worked in his favour.

Javadekar was seen to have held his own in the fierce and politically charged debates over the odd-even and diesel vehicles. The minister worked to coor dinate pollution control in the NCR region and backed the move to usher in Euro VI norms. The ministry took steps to cut delay in decision-making and improved transparency.

Javadekar's handling of key negotiations during the Paris climate conference, that ended up addressing the country's key points, is also cited as an important achievement for him.

Hailing from Pune, the 65year-old former bank official has a good head for numbers and is known for a pragmatic approach. He can grapple with detail, and despite not being the most fluent speakers, can argue a case with passion and conviction.",2016-07-06T02:25:00Z

""That is their (Shiv Sena) opinion, the opinion of millions of people in India are different. Mr Modi has been been championing the cause of India globally,"" Prabhu said at a press conference here.

Stating that Prime Minister Modi is respected globally, Railways Minister Prabhu, who hails from Maharashtra, said Modi is respected as a leader both in the developed world as well as in the developing world.

""Mr Modi has been given the rare honour of addressing the joint sitting of US Congress ,"" he said.

""Mr Modi has also been given the highest civilian award of UAE. So we should be proud that our Prime Minister is honoured globally,"" Prabhu said while commenting on Sena's remarks against Modi in party mouthpiece 'Saamna'.

""He is accepted in the East, he is accepted in the West, he is accepted in the global family,"" Prabhu, who quit Shiv Sena in 2014 to join BJP, said.

He said Modi is regarded highly among African nations, the Pacific Islands as also in Latin American countries.

Stressing on Modi's importance in the global scenario, Prabhu said US President Barack Obama had called the Indian Prime Minister over phone to seek his views on climate change issues.

Shiv Sena had yesterday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's remarks in Doha about India being plagued by corruption ""maligned the nation's image"", and questioned if scams in BJP-ruled Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat can be attributed to the Gandhi family.

Since Modi is the face of the nation, other countries may believe what he says about India which in turn might affect the financial condition of the country, an editorial in Sena's mouthpiece 'Saamna' said. Vowing to root out corruption in India, the Prime Minister had on June 12 said in Doha on the second leg of his five-nation visit that he ""faced problems"" by depriving many people of their ""sweets"" and saved over Rs 36,000 crore annually by stopping leakage and theft in government schemes.

The Times of India,Kamrup(M) to set up Swachh Bharat Clubs for clean city - Times of India,Abdul Gani,"Guwahati: The Kamrup (Metro) district administration has decided to set up Swachh Bharat Clubs in residential areas and on school and college premises as part of its endeavour to make the city clean and green.

Deputy commissioner M Angamuthu said initiatives would be taken to ensure mass participation of men, women and children.

""A mission is successful only when there is mass participation of locals. Keeping this in mind, we have decided to form Swachh Bharat Clubs in residential areas and educational institutions. It is very important for students to develop a habit of keeping the environment clean,"" said Angamuthu.

The Kamrup (Metro) district will also involve various NGOs and youth organizations in a series of programmes to protect the environment.

""The Kamrup (Metro) district administration pledges to preserve the biodiversity and ecosystem of the city. Encroachments close to primary water channels like the Bharalu river are being removed. More such eco-friendly steps will be taken soon,"" Angamuthu added.

The district administration has also focused on identifying open spaces where it can conduct plantation drives.

A report on Guwahati by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI), as part of the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network (ACCCRN), has said the city's hills and natural wetland areas should be preserved as they act as buffers in flood-management.

It has also suggested that Guwahati Municipal Corporation (GMC) and Guwahati Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) should take into account the location of the water bodies, green/ open areas and parks while allocating land.

The city has an area of 216.79 sqkm, of which 13.60% is covered by forests. Over the years, however, the increase of population and construction in the hills have reduced the vegetation cover.

Mumbai, Apr 6 () Development financial institution Nabard today reported a 13 per cent jump in profit after tax (PAT) at Rs 2,501 crore in 2015-16 on increased rural infrastructure development fund (RIDF) disbursements and higher term lending.

In the previous fiscal, its PAT stood at Rs 2,403 crore.

""Nabard is very sound institution and we are the only institution in the developmental banking space to cross balance sheet size of Rs 3 lakh crore,"" Nabard Chairman Harsh Kumar Bhanwala told reporters here today.

He said the profit improved on account to higher RIDF disbursements and term lending which resulted in increase in credit demand and capital formation in agriculture sector.

It's balance sheet grew by 15 per cent to Rs 3,10,382 crore in 2015-16 as against Rs 2,85,809 crore.

Loans and advances stood at Rs 2,65,361 crore in the year ended March 31, up 12 per cent from Rs 2,52,369 crore.

The Times of India,Will follow scientific process to dispose of Deonar waste: BMC - Times of India,,"Mumbai, Mar 31 () A day after holding a meeting with Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar in light of the fire incidents at Deonar dumping yard, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) today said it would follow a scientific process to dispose of waste.

Mumbai, Mar 31 () A day after holding a meeting with Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar in light of the fire incidents at Deonar dumping yard, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) today said it would follow a scientific process to dispose of waste.

Asked what the civic body would do to counter the menace of dumping waste in the city at Deonar yard amid serious health and environmental concerns, BMC Commissioner Ajoy Mehta told : ""Now we are moving Deonar towards scientific processing the waste.""

Mehta had yesterday apprised Environment Ministry officials about corrective and precautionary measures being undertaken by the civic administration in the wake of frequent fires at suburban Deonar dumping ground, causing emission of toxic gases and leading to lakhs of residents living in its vicinity being exposed to high pollution levels.

The 90-minute meeting in Delhi yesterday was chaired by Union Minister of State for Environment, Forests and Climate Change Prakash Javdekar.

""In wake of recent fires in #Deonar garbage dumping site, discussed short,medium & long-measures for effective integrated waste management,"" Javadekar tweeted.

""...asked the Maha and Mumbai Mahanagar Palika officials to have an integrated waste management system in #Deonar,"" he said in another tweet.

Earlier, taking a serious note of frequent fires at Deonar dumping ground, the Environment Ministry had sent a two-member committee to probe the matter and submit a report. The committee submitted its report yesterday to the ministry.

Commenting on the issue, activist Anil Galgali said it is surprising that BMC is struggling with the problem when options like recycling waste and generating electricity are available.

""The situation has arisen because scientific disposal of garbage is not done, while a smaller municipal corporation like Navi Mumbai has set up debris management plant,"" he said.

The issue has also sparked political spar.

Holding the Shiv Sena and BJP responsible for the situation, Mumbai Congress chief Sanjay Nirupam had earlier sought to put blame on these two parties. ""Since last 23 years these two parties are ruling one of the richest municipal bodies, but they never bothered to develop a mechanism to dispose the waste scientifically, while many national and international cities have gone far ahead of us,"" Nirupam had said.

The Times of India,'TN govt interested in protecting those pilfering electricity' - Times of India,,"Chennai, Mar 31 () Escalating its attack on the AIADMK dispensation, Union Minister and BJP leader Prakash Javadekar today alleged the Tamil Nadu government was not opting for the Centre-led power reforms initiatives and was only interested in protecting those pilfering electricity.

Chennai, Mar 31 () Escalating its attack on the AIADMK dispensation, Union Minister and BJP leader Prakash Javadekar today alleged the Tamil Nadu government was not opting for the Centre-led power reforms initiatives and was only interested in protecting those pilfering electricity.

Referring to Uday scheme, a Centre-led power reforms initiative, he said if implemented, it would bring tremendous benefits to honest power consumers.

""But the Tamil Nadu government is not interested in benefitting honest electricity consumers, but dishonest who put unauthorised connections and steal electricity... The government is interested in protecting them,"" he said.

Claiming that Uday was appreciated by 90 per cent of the people in 18 states, he said it was not unfortunately signed by Tamil Nadu. ""I hope one day Tamil Nadu will realise and sign it.""

Days ago, his Cabinet colleague Piyush Goyal had targeted the state government over the same issue and claimed that Chief Minister Jayalalithaa was ""inaccessible"".

Javadekar said the Uday scheme would ensure turnaround of discoms (power distribution companies) and bring them out of debt (as) ""they will have less interest rates... 30 per cent less interest burden and there are many other benefits.""

Citing another central scheme, UJALA (Unnat Jyoti by Affordable LEDs for All), he said he really failed to understand why Tamil Nadu had not taken up this scheme.

He said the scheme directly benefited people, reducing their power bills. It is a climate change initiative ""but Tamil Nadu government is not interested in any of these"".

Explaining how prices of LED bulbs had come down due to efforts like the scheme, he claimed that ""nine crore people, households across country have benefitted"" through cost effective LED lights and they are saving on energy bills.

He also blamed what he called ""Tamil Nadu Government's attitude"" on an environmental issue over the Kasturirangan report, vis-a-vis Western Ghats that came under his Ministry.

Of the six states along Western Ghats (Gujarat, Goa, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu), only Tamil Nadu had not given its proposal and after continuous follow-up, they said they needed time till May 16, he said.

""But we are following it up for one year. Kerala and other states gave their reports months ago. But Tamil Nadu did not submit,"" he said.

Javadekar said the BJP government was interested in good governance and does not discriminate against any government. ""We believe in cooperative federalism. If the state is not taking lead, people will suffer,"" he said. Earlier, he chaired a meeting of top state BJP leaders where issues on the May 16 polls were discussed, including release of the remaining list of candidates. VGN APR SMN",2016-03-31T10:42:00Z
The Times of India,World T20: Here's reason to watch India-Pakistan match in the dark - Times of India,,"JAIPUR: It's Earth Hour Day on March 19. What started as a token switching off of all lights in Sydney, Australia, for one day in 2007 has now spread across the world. Last year, 172 nations participated in the lights-off movement. This year, those participating in this event will turn off their lights between 8.30 pm and 9.30 pm on Saturday.

Cricketer Shikhar Dhawan, who has thrown his weight behind Earth Hour, said, ""Like cricket, Earth Hour brings people together. I urge people to come together and find newer, smarter ways to help save the planet."" He urged fans to turn off non-essential lights and watch the India-Pakistan T20 ICC World Cup match of March 19 in the dark.

On December 12 last year, 195 nations signed a new international agreement towards a low-carbon, climate-resilient world at the Paris Climate Conference. The Earth Hour movement was born a decade earlier, out of the need for raising awareness about climate change.

This year, the focus of the campaign in India is to harness more fully the potential of solar energy. India, according to WWF, has at least 300 clear sunny days each year; it has potential to generate 5,000 trillion kWh of energy per year from solar energy - that is more that the country's total annual energy requirement.

Lights will go off at the India Gate, Gateway of India, Rashtrapati Bhawan and Lotus Temple too on Earth Hour.

Speaking of Jaipur's participation in Earth Hour, Gerda Unnithan, the force behind the city's sparrow conservation effort, said, ""Unfortunately, not many people know of Earth Hour in Jaipur. I must confess that I too have only observed it once in the past 10 years. But it is an initiative worth supporting, one that more and more people should learn about.""",2016-03-17T14:17:00Z
The Hindu,Dams without responsibility,Meena Menon,"Uttarakhand has to ensure that the quest for hydropower cannot come without a responsibility to preserve a region that is limping back to life after a calamity aggravated by unplanned human interventions neither scientifically assessed nor endorsed by the people of the region
The devastation in Uttarakhand had already happened much before the cataclysmic events of June 2013.  The unprecedented rainfall and floods and loss of life drew attention to the alarming situation in a State known for its pristine forests and rivers.  It also drew attention belatedly to the ""bumper to bumper"" dams in the mountains.
 Construction on all dams in Uttarakhand was halted by the Supreme Court in August 2013 and on its instructions, the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) appointed an expert body which said that 23 hydropower projects out of the 24 it was asked to examine would have an irreversible impact on the biodiversity of the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi basins and should not be constructed.
 In May, the Supreme Court reiterated its orders stopping work on the 24 hydropower projects examined by the body.  While all this amounts to shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted, it is a measure of recognition of the man-made destruction wrought by unplanned hydel power projects in a sensitive and fragile ecosystem.
 The body's report said, ""The problem with the dams is their location in a high or very high biodiversity value area, some of them at elevations above 2,200-2,500 metres.  These altitudes come in the paraglacial and glacial zones and in these zones, the rivers are capable of mobilizing tremendous amounts of sediments, under intense rainfall conditions, from the moraine left behind in the past by receding glaciers.  In such situations, they cause havoc in the vicinity of dams as witnessed at the Vishnuprayag barrage site and below during the June 2013 disaster."" ""
The State of Uttarakhand is a part of the Ganga basin and rivers suffer from several depradations apart from dams in high places, including extensive pollution from untreated sewage.  Despite huge amounts of money being spent, plans to clean up the river have failed miserably.  An IIT-led consortium has been set up to prepare a master plan for the National Ganga River Basin Authority (NGRBA), to restore its ""wholesomeness,"" as the extended summary of a draft Ganga River Basin Management plan says.  Citing anthropogenic activities, it says dams and barrages have snapped her ""longitudinal connectivity."" ""
While the recent Ganga Manthan event in Delhi attracted more than its fair share of sadhus, there were a few who spoke against dams and said that they were a threat to the river's existence.  But the focus was on keeping the river Ganga ""aviral and nirmal"" (continuous and unpolluted flow).  Activists said only cleaning up the river will not restore it.  Some pointed to the lack of studies of the entire river system and hydrological data which was a secret.  Since the Ganga is glacier fed, the climate change impact in the Himalayan ecosystem and on the receding Gangotri and other glaciers are also of paramount importance.
 In its report of March 2013, the Inter-Ministerial Group (IMG) on Issues Relating to River Ganga says that the development of new hydro power projects has an impact on the environment, the ecology, the biodiversity, both terrestrial and aquatic, and economic and social life.  Crucially, it says that in the upper reaches of the river -- where the oxygenating abilities of the river are the highest -- there are growing signs of contamination.  This suggests that even here, water withdrawal for hydroelectricity is endangering the health of the Ganga.  Implementation of the 69 hydro power projects will lead to 81 per cent of the Bhagirathi and 65 per cent of the Alaknanda getting affected.  The IMG had considered the need to have portions of the river free of hydro projects and recommended that six rivers should be kept in pristine form.
 In the Alaknanda and Bhagirathi basins, the report said that 17 dams have been commissioned with a total installed capacity of 1,851 MW.  Fourteen projects of 2,538 MW capacity are in different stages of construction and 39 projects with an installed capacity of 4,644 MW are in different stages of planning.  The expert body report said that if all the 450 dams in the State are completed, about 252 projects will each have an installed capacity of 5MW or more.  The vast majority of them will divert rivers through tunnels to power houses downstream.  Their combined impact will affect the landscape of Uttarakhand.  The environment management plans of individual projects do not address the cumulative impacts of multiple projects in a river valley.
 With dams proposed on major rivers for every 20 to 25 kilometre stretch, large fragments of these rivers could be left with minimal flow as almost all the river water is extracted for producing hydroelectricity, the body's report has said.  Prof.  Ravi Chopra, chairperson of the body said that tunnelling is also controversial and leads to damage with natural springs being diverted and homes developing cracks.  The government has only looked at the need to generate power and not the impact on the environment.  On field visits, the body noticed scarred landscapes, dry river beds and a complete disappearance of riverine ecosystems due to submergence at existing and under construction large hydropower projects such as Tehri Stage I and Koteshwar on the Bhagirathi basin and the Srinagar dam in the Alaknanda basin.
 If all the dams are built, studies indicate a loss of biodiversity.  A National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) report, quoted by the body, has highlighted the effect of the Tehri dam on the unique self-purifying ability of Gangajal.  It attributed this property to river sediments; data indicated that the blocking of sediments behind the Tehri dam diminished this property.
 Extensive deforestation and diversion of forest land too has posed problems.  The body found that 80,826.91 hectares of forests have been diverted for non-forest use in Uttarakhand since 1980.  The diversion for hydropower production is 5,312.11 ha.  Most of the diversion for roads and hydropower has been in Uttarkashi, Rudraprayag, Chamoli and Pithoragarh districts, the areas most affected in the June 2013 disaster.
 People have been agitating against dams for years in the region, notably Tehri.  In 2010-11, and for the first time for any project, there were three public hearings on the Devsari hydel project on the Pinder.  After two hearings, the third one was accepted by the government, according to Vimalbhai of the Matu Jansangthan which led protests along with the Bhu-Swami Sangharsh Samiti.  He says this was the first major protest after the ones against Tehri.  A public hearing was also organised where many voiced their opposition to the dams and on the need to keep the undammed tributary of the Ganga that way.  He referred to the pathetic status of the catchment area, and the lack of studies on water flows and climate change impacts.  The people displaced by the Tehri dam are still to get land rights or basic amenities in their relocated homes, he added.
 Local people who have borne the brunt of the devastation due to dams and floods and environmental groups have questioned the feasibility of dams.  By all accounts there is cause for concern as reflected in many reports.  Even as the Uttarakhand government proposes to approach the Supreme Court in a bid to get a green signal for dam construction, it must remember this.  It has to ensure that the quest for hydropower cannot come without a responsibility to preserve a region that is limping back to life after a calamity aggravated by unplanned human interventions neither scientifically assessed nor endorsed by the people of the region.",2014-07-15T21:45:00Z

Hindustan Times,"El Nino stays strong, experts fear impact on winter, 2024",,"New Delhi: There is about a 95% chance that 2023 will be the warmest or the second-warmest year on record, a key US government agency said in a briefing on Thursday and warned that several more months -- possibly stretching into 2024 -- could continue the heat trend thanks to the El Nino weather pattern remaining strong.

Between January and August, global land and ocean temperatures were 1.06°C above the base period of 1991 to 2020, making it the second warmest January to August period in history, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

""Nobody knows when this is going to end but El Nino is still strengthening. As a result of that, we expect heat to continue for the rest of 2023 with a 95% chance of this being the warmest or second warmest year on record. It's possible that 2024 could be even warmer than 2023. We anticipate to be in this record category globally for several months to come,"" said Karin Gleason, monitoring section chief, NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.

El Nino, a periodic but unusual warming of the waters in the equatorial Pacific region, has a cascading impact around the world, including in India where it saps the monsoon rains. El Nino conditions are expected to continue through the upcoming Winter, with a 95% chance of it remaining in place for January to March, 2024, and around a 70% chance of a strong El Nino being in place for the November-December-January period, the scientists from NOAA said.

Gleason, when asked on what this means for the critical 1.5°C average warming threshold being breached, told HT: ""We don't really deal with predictions as to how far it will go but we know it has been warm and have been exceeding previous margins significantly the last couple of months. We are reaching certain months that are exceeding 1°C. We are watching that closely.""

Global land and ocean temperatures in August were 1.25°C higher compared to 1991 to 2020 base period, warmest in 174 years and global land temperature alone was a record 1.72°C above the base period, NOAA stated.

The June and August months together were also the warmest since 1850, with land temperature alone recording 1.51°C above the 1991-2020 base period. East and Peninsular India recorded land temperatures warmest ever during June and August, NOAA indicated in its map.

Above average sea surface temperatures are being observed across most of the Pacific Ocean near the equator -- the oceanic and atmospheric observations currently reflect El Nino conditions.""Right now, in tropical Pacific the sea surface temp are 1.6°C above normal, and it's already above the threshold for a strong event. Going ahead a strong event is more likely than not,"" said Scott Handel, Meteorologist, NOAA Climate Prediction Center.

The record heat is comes at a time of flagging global momentum to limit warming to the Paris Agreement's 1.5 °C goal. HT reported on Thursday that UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres said the world is heading towards 2.8°C of warming if global leaders do not act now.

He was addressing the UN Climate Ambition Summit, where major emitters such as the United States, China, UK and India were notably absent.

But, several heads of states and cities demanded action on fossil fuels at the summit. Governor of California, Gavin Newsom said: ""This climate crisis is a fossil fuel crisis. It's not complicated. It's the burning of oil. It's the burning of gas. It's the burning of coal. And we need to call that out. For decades and decades, the fossil fuel industry has been playing each and every one of us in this room for fools.""

Gabriel Boric, President of Chile said: ""The climate crisis is a fossil fuel crisis, so we need to leave fossil fuels behind. That in very specific terms means we must react to the greenwashing that major businesses are undertaking.

COP 28 President Designate, Sultan Al Jaber said during the summit on Wednesday: ""We know the size of the problem. The numbers are straightforward: 22 gigatons. That's the amount of greenhouse gas emissions we need to cut in the next seven years to keep 1.5°C within reach.""",2023-09-21T19:09:00Z

The Hindu,"Scientists, scholars and students come together to observe 'India March for Science'",,"India March for Science (IMFS) is observed every year in the month of August across the country since 2017. Scientists, research scholars, various science organisations, students and science enthusiasts from around the world participate. The IMFS is an integral part of the Global March for Science Movement.

The purpose of this programme is to celebrate science and inspire scientific spirit amongst the masses. Science-loving people of Mysuru took part in the observance of IMFS at Ekalavya Circle here on Saturday, August 19. Despite rains, the spirit to stand for science wasn't dampened.

The IMFS was inaugurated by Prof. P. Venkataramaiah, former VC of Kuvempu University; Vidya Shankar, former headmistress, Vidyavardhaka Sangha School; Shashidhar Dongre M., science communicator; Dipti B., State Secretary, Breakthrough Science Society and Niranjan Hiremath, Mysuru unit in charge of Breakthrough Science Society, by watering a plant.

Speaking after the inauguration, Prof. P. Venkataramaiah spoke on the importance of not falling victim to superstitions and the importance of science education in this regard which helps to shun superstitions. He also said programmes like IMFS are important for spreading the message on climate change.

Niranjan Hiremath spoke about the importance of the March for Science programme and said that these kinds of programs will be very important to promote science and give more publicity to science. The theme for March for Science this year was ""Save Soil"", ""Save Trees"", and ""Save Environment"", he said.

Scientist Shivprakash Adavanne said Mysuru is home to many unique birds and plants, and all of us must preserve this biodiversity and the lakes of Mysuru. When biodiversity is saved then we can address climate change. The future generations must lay emphasis on environment and biodiversity conservation.

Ms. Dipti spoke about the importance of scientific temper in society and said scientific temper is not only to be practised in classrooms and laboratories but in everyday life. She said asking ""why"" and ""how"" in classrooms and home can go a long way in building an empowered society with a strong mind set towards progress, innovation and growth of society.",2023-08-19T15:45:20Z
Hindustan Times,"Nod for jet, sub deals as Modi lands in Paris",,"India's defence acquisition council (DAC) on Thursday cleared the Indian Navy's proposals to acquire 26 Rafale Marine combat jets and three more Scorpene-class submarines from France -- deals set to be announced in Paris, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi landed later in the day for an official visit that aims to bolster bilateral ties and open new avenues of cooperation.

Modi's participation as guest of honour in the French National Day, or Bastille Day, celebrations on Friday will be the highlight of the 36-hour visit.

""I am confident that my visit will provide a new impetus to our strategic partnership,"" Modi said in a statement ahead of his departure for Paris. ""I look forward to meeting President [Emmanuel] Macron and holding wide-ranging discussions on taking forward this longstanding and time-tested partnership over the next 25 years,"" he added.

On his arrival in Paris, Modi was received at the airport by French premier Elisabeth Borne, and given a ceremonial welcome and a guard of honour. ""Landed in Paris. Looking forward to boosting India-France cooperation during this visit,"" he tweeted.

Modi said in his statement that the visit is ""particularly special"" as he will join Macron for the Bastille Day Parade in Paris as the guest of honour. An Indian tri-services contingent will be part of the parade, while three French-origin Rafale jets of the Indian Air Force (IAF) will join a fly-past on the occasion.

Referring to the 25th anniversary of the India-France strategic partnership, Modi said it is rooted in deep trust and commitment, and the two countries cooperate closely in areas such as defence, space, civil nuclear, blue economy, trade, investment, education, culture and people-to-people ties.

Besides hosting a private dinner for Modi late on Thursday, Macron will hold formal talks with the Indian leader on Friday after they participate in the military parade. Both leaders will also participate in an India-France CEOs Forum and Modi will separately meet prominent personalities. The visit will conclude with a banquet hosted by Macron at the Louvre Museum.

Modi also said that he looked forward to his interactions with the French leadership, including Borne, Senate president Gerard Larcher, and National Assembly president Yael Braun-Pivet.

Meanwhile, in New Delhi, the decks were cleared for the announcement of the two big-ticket defence deals as India's DAC on Thursday approved the Indian Navy's proposals to buy 26 Rafale Marine jets and three more Scorpene submarines to sharpen its operational capabilities, officials aware of the matter said.

DAC, headed by defence minister Rajnath Singh, accorded its acceptance of necessity (AoN) for the Rafale M jets for use with the first indigenous aircraft carrier, INS Vikrant, and for building three Scorpene submarines in the country through transfer of technology. Under India's defence procurement rules, the AoN by the council is the first step towards buying military hardware.

The two deals are estimated to have a combined value of €9 billion to €10 billion, though the final price will be determined after complex negotiations between India and France, the officials said, asking not to be named.

The Rafale procurement will include weapons, simulators, spares, associated equipment, crew training and logistics support for the Indian Navy from the French government based on an inter-governmental agreement, the defence ministry said in a statement.

The Rafale M edged out the American F/A-18 Super Hornet in a direct competition to equip the navy with new deck-based fighters.

The price and other terms of purchase will be negotiated with the French government after factoring in all relevant aspects, including the comparative procurement price of similar aircraft by other countries, the statement said.

""Further, integration of Indian designed equipment and establishment of maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) hub for various systems will be incorporated into the contract documents after due negotiations,"" it said.

IAF operates 36 Rafale jets bought from France at a cost of ₹59,000 crore, and the aircraft's naval variant will bring commonality with the IAF's fighters, creating advantages in training, maintenance and logistics support.

The Rafale M jets are being imported as an interim measure to meet the navy's needs until India develops its own twin-engine deck-based fighter (TEDBF). The first prototype of TEDBF could make its maiden flight by 2026 and be ready for production by 2031, HT has learnt.

The procurement of three submarines under the ""Buy (Indian)"" category will be a follow-on order to an earlier deal whereby state-run Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL) in Mumbai built six Scorpene or Kalvari class submarines with technology from France's Naval Group under a ₹23,562-crore programme called Project-75. The sixth vessel is set to be inducted in the Indian Navy early next year.

""The procurement of additional submarines, with higher indigenous content, will not only help in maintaining required force level and operational readiness of the Indian Navy, but also create significant employment opportunities in the domestic sector,"" the statement said. ""It will also help MDL in further enhancing its capability and expertise in submarine construction.""

The three submarines will be fitted with air-independent propulsion (AIP) systems to allow them to remain submerged for longer.

From Paris, Modi will travel to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for an official visit on July 15. ""I look forward to meeting my friend, H.H. Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, President of the UAE and Ruler of Abu Dhabi,"" he said in his departure statement.

India and the UAE are engaged across a wide range of sectors such as trade, investments, energy, food security, science and technology, education, fintech, defence, security, and robust people-to-people ties, he said.

Last year, Mohamed bin Zayed and Modi agreed on a roadmap on the future of the bilateral partnership, and Modi said he looks forward to ""discussing with him how to further deepen our ties"".

The UAE will be hosting the COP28 this year, and Modi said he would discuss ways to strengthen ""global cooperation towards accelerating climate action to facilitate the energy transition and implementation of the Paris Agreement"".",2023-07-13T19:48:00Z
The Hindu,How the G20 evolved,,"India's assumption of the 18th G20 (Group of Twenty) presidency underpins a new epoch for the grouping. For the first time, the 'Troika' will be comprised of three emerging market economies - Indonesia, India, and Brazil. The G20 chair is part of a rotating three-member group of immediate past, current, and succeeding presidencies, referred to as the Troika to ensure continuity in the agenda as there is no permanent G20 secretariat. The G20 summits are convened under a system of rotational presidencies and are selected from a different regional grouping of countries. In fact, South Africa's elevation to the G20 presidency in 2025 will not only consolidate the voice of the Global South but will also mark the completion of one full circle for rotational presidencies among member countries. India has planned to hold the Summit in New Delhi on September 9-10, 2023.

India has taken over the G20 presidency on the occasion of the country completing 75 years of its independence and becoming the fifth-largest economy in the world. Thus, with an avowed objective of showcasing its rich cultural heritage and economic prowess to the outside world, it is setting unique precedence by holding more than 200 meetings in over 50 cities spread across country and not confining to a select few large cities.

The run-up to the Summit entails a preparatory process with several ministerial and working group meetings and discussions channeled on two tracks- the Finance Track and the Sherpa Track. In the Finance Track, discussions are centered on building consensus on attendant issues related to fiscal and monetary policies, macroeconomic coordination, financial inclusion, international taxation, and investment. The deliberations under the Sherpa Track are both complementary and supplementary to those undertaken in the Finance Track as the scope of discussions expands to subjects like digital economy, trade, and investment, anti-corruption, agriculture, health, energy and environment, among others.

Inception of G20: rise of emerging markets in the multilateral order

With the G20 becoming a subject of intense debate and discussion in India, it is important to reflect on its history and evolution.

To those unfamiliar with the G20 process, it is less well-known that the G20 was conceived in 1999 in the aftermath of the 1997 Asian financial crisis to discuss matters related to international economic and financial stability and align policies among the most significant and relevant industrialized and developing economies. Until then, the group of advanced countries- the Group of Seven (G7)- was the main forum that discussed international issues ranging from global financial governance to anti-corruption and terror financing, with the view to build consensus and policy response among developed countries. However, the Asian financial crisis brought to the fore the criticality and centrality of developing countries to maintain the multilateral order owing to their deep integration into the global economic systems and cross-border capital flows. Since the immediate context was to mitigate the ill effects of the contagion caused by the Asian financial crisis, the beginning of the G20 (with the addition of 12 economies to the G7 countries) was underpinned by the coming together of their Finance Ministers and central bank governors to discuss how a coordinated response to the emergent crisis and future crises could be made.

Evolution of the G20

Since then, the G20 has seen several points of inflection. The first happened in 2008 in the aftermath of the global financial crisis that emerged in the U.S. when the forum was elevated to the summit level with the participation of heads of state or government. The initial summits, held in the U.S., the U.K., and Canada focused on developing a coordinated response to the financial crisis and the consequent economic slowdown, including discussions on monetary and fiscal policy measures, preventing a reversion to protectionist policies and reforming of the Bretton Woods institutions. Other issues such as strengthening trade and investments were discussed in the larger context of their impact on ensuring financial stability and economic growth. Issues like food security which were discussed at the G7 level till then also found their way in the G20 agenda.

The next pivotal moment was during the South Korean presidency in 2010 when development issues were introduced as a priority in the G20 agenda. In the subsequent years, as the effects of the global financial crisis waned and financial sector stability was restored to an extent, the mandate of the Sherpa Track expanded. Many new working groups were added to reflect the widened ambit. Successive presidencies -- France, Mexico, Russia, Australia, Turkey, and China -- focused on various issues reflecting their respective priorities and relevance to the G20 community.

In 2017, amidst the U.S.-China trade war and divergence of opinion on multiple issues including climate change, the G20 weathered the storm by following a majority over unanimity. For the first time, the G20 recorded a Leader's Declaration with 19 members supporting the agenda, alongside the dissent of one. While failure to build consensus may have set a bad precedent, from a global governance perspective it exemplified the point that no one nation is superior in the grouping. In that way, the German presidency in 2017 can also be regarded as critical for the G20. The Argentinian and Japanese presidencies also withstood turbulent times and widened the scope of the G20 agenda to reflect on new issues like the future of work, which had gained prominence and cast a long shadow on international policymaking.

Covid-19, resilience, recovery and relevance

In 2020, the significance of the G20 was realized one more time when it was held amidst the looming shadow of the COVID-19 pandemic which made a coordinated response a necessity for weathering the storm and recovering with resilience. A set of policies and emergency measures were put together by G20 leaders for protecting people and safeguarding the global economy in response to the pandemic. The subsequent Italian and the Indonesian presidencies continued to focus on the post-pandemic recovery.

While it seems that the pandemic is largely behind us, the scare caused by the current outbreak in China, the prevailing food and energy crisis caused by the raging Russia-Ukraine conflict, the effects of climate change, and the ominous clouds of global recession caused by sticky inflation have made building consensus on a multitude of global issues during the Indian presidency a formidable task. Under the apt theme of ""Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam"" (or ""One Earth, One Family, One Future""), India is determined to reinforce the point that the world is one family, and the need for coordinated action has never been so dire. In the current milieu of fragilities and opportunities in the multilateral setting, the G20 is perhaps the only inclusive forum that can set the agenda for global peace and harmony.

The Times of India,ADB to provide USD 500 mn loan for putting up solar rooftops - Times of India,,"New Delhi, Oct 4 () Multi-lateral lender Asian Development Bank (ADB) will extend a USD 500 million loan for installing solar rooftop systems to help India expand its renewable energy footprint.

""ADB is set to provide USD 500 million in financing for rooftop solar systems that will help the Indian government expand energy access using renewable energy,"" it said in a statement.

The financing comprises USD 330 million from ADB and USD 170 million from the multi-donor Clean Technology Fund, administered by the funding agency.

""This funding should mean that 11 million fewer tonnes of greenhouse gases are emitted over the typical 25-year lifetime of solar rooftop systems,"" ADB said.

The financing will be channalised through state-owned Punjab National Bank, which will use the ADB funds to tender loans to various developers and end-users across the country to set up solar rooftop systems.

""There is a huge potential for India to expand its use of solar rooftop technologies because of the sharp drop in the price of solar panels, meaning the cost of producing solar energy is at or close to that from fossil fuels,"" said Anqian Huang, finance specialist in ADB's South Asia Department.

Sourcing more solar energy will also help India meet the carbon emissions reduction target that it has committed to, as part of the recent global climate change agreement, Huang said.

Combined with an additional USD 300 million in subproject equity investment and USD 200 million in loans from commercial banks and other financiers, the entire cost of the Solar Rooftop Investment Programme is USD 1 billion.

The Government aims to increase the amount of energy sourced from solar rooftop systems to 40 gigawatts by 2022.

The fresh funding is to further the goal under Jawaharlal Nehru National Solar Mission to increase India's overall solar energy generation to 100 gigawatts by 2022.

India has targeted to lower its carbon emissions by 33 per cent from 2005 levels so as to substitute it by non-fossil fuel based power under the 2015 Paris climate agreement.

Besides, ADB has also committed to double its annual financing for climate mitigation and adaption to USD 6 billion by 2020 to support India's cause.

The solar rooftop market is still at an early stage of development in India and awareness of the latest technologies and the financial benefits is low. Banks see lending to such projects as risky, partly because of limited past experiences. KPM JM",2016-10-04T09:01:00Z
The Times of India,"First time ever in India: Blue Whale calf successfully rescued, released in deep waters off Maharashtra's Ganpatipule | Mumbai News - Times of India",,"MUMBAI: A Blue Whale calf -- stranded off Ganpatipule in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra -- was successfully rescued and led into the deep waters after nearly 35 hours on the seashore.

""It is the only successful rescue of a beached Blue Whale in India. It was strapped and at high tide it was gently pulled two nautical miles into deep sea where it vigorously swam away.It would, however, need to find its mother to survive,"" said Praveen Pardeshi, president,Bombay Natural History Society.

Environmentalists call this incident ""the first-ever in India"".

It was on Monday morning that Arti Kulkarni, a local environmentalist, who first put out a post on social media on the calf being stranded and locals hydrating it with sea water, said environmentalist Debi Goenka.

The range forest officer visited the site but then left soon after.

It was over 24 hours since the calf had been stranded on the shores and lying continuously exposed to the sun meant sun burns, said Goenka.

Goenka got in touch with S Temburnikar, principal chief conservator of forests, and V Reddy, principal secretary, revenue and forests.

Temburnikar responded immediately and set the rescue operation in motion.

Soon the district forest officer Girija Desai and her team arrived at the site.

The whale was covered with a white sheet, put on saline and veterinary doctor was posted full time to monitor the mammal.

All this time local residents, and NGOs continued to keep it hydrated with sea water.

The forest officer got in touch with the coast guard and the Indian Navy for equipment to lead the whale into the deep waters.

""The mammal weighed five tonnes. The coast guard tug boat was too small so the Indian Navy got its helicopter but made it clear that the mammal was too huge to be air lifted by the helicopter,"" said V Ben Clement, additional principal chief conservator of forests, Western Regional Wildlife, Mumbai.

In the meantime, Pardeshi, who learned of it, got in touch with JSW which had a tug boat that could take the animal out into the deep waters.

It was strapped and around 9.30 pm on Tuesday night was gently pulled into the sea.

Whales move in a group called a pod.

Clement said the reasons for the Blue Whale drifting away from the pod and being beached could vary.

""It could be high/low tide dynamics, illness or it could be Sonar radiation (from submarines) that could have interfered with its internal navigation system.

""It was over 35 hours early Wednesday morning that it was finally released in deep sea waters around 7-8 nautical miles from the shore,"" said Clement.

Goenka said beaching of whales was a global phenomenon and such incidents were only increasing.

""We don't the exact reason why this particular whale was stranded. It could be undersea blasting by oil companies, climate change, sonar radiation...The whale was not wounded or injured so possibly its internal navigation mechanism was disrupted,"" said Goenka.

Goenka said it is only in recent years that there is a study of marine ecology in Maharashtra thanks to funds from the Mangrove Foundation.

""It is difficult to get officers and scientists to work in the field. What this incident has thrown up is that we need a better rapid response. The coast guard needs to be better prepared, a list of locally available equipment needs to be in place. For once the forest department did a great job,"" said Goenka.",2023-11-15T09:23:47Z

The Times of India,HC: Raze illegal structures on Merces khazans by Nov 30 | Goa News - Times of India,,"Panaji: The high court of Bombay at Goa recently issued final orders directing the Goa government to demolish illegal structures at Morombi-O-Grande village in Merces by the end of this month. Locals and activists hailed the verdict and the legal battle initiated by Jose Oliveira, a Merces resident, against unauthorised construction on khazan lands.

""There are numerous other instances of destruction of the village's khazans, and I vow that I will take this battle to its logical conclusion,"" Oliveira said.

Merces, which lies on the southern entrance to Panaji, is adorned with vast khazans and mangrove forests. Its khazans are integral to the cultural and economic fabric of neighbouring villages, but have faced continuous threats from both planned and unplanned development. Abhijit Prabhugaonkar of the citizens' group, Rainbow Warriors, said the ecosystem surrounding the khazans have been testament to rich traditions and have provided economic sustenance to the villagers for decades.

The legal struggle, spanning seven years and involving appearances before the Goa Coastal Zone Management Authority, the high court, the National Green Tribunal, and even the Supreme Court, reached its zenith on November 7 last year, when the Supreme Court upheld demolition orders. The Goa government, however, delayed demolition for over a year, prompting Oliveira to seek redress from the high court, which swiftly granted his plea, said Prabhugaonkar.

Oliveira said the true victory lies in the actual demolition of illegal structures and restoration of the khazans.

Green activist, Avertino Miranda, emphasised the urgency of statewide action against such environmental degradation to avert a looming climate crisis.

""Unless strict action is taken across the state against such destruction of khazans, the climate crisis and resultant extreme storms, floods, rising sea levels will prove to be unmanageable and disastrous for our state and its people,"" Miranda said.",2023-11-13T23:27:26Z

Smaller countries like Bangladesh (106) and Israel (115) were placed better than India.

The index examines inclusivity in terms of race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability, and the general population using several measures.The measures include out-group violence, political representation, income inequality, anti-discrimination laws, rate of incarceration, and immigration/ asylum policies, as per a release from OBI.

India was ranked last (129) in religion inclusiveness, 121st in gender, 108th in disability, 87th in race, 40th in the general population, and 39th in LGBTQ.

Villupuram MP D Ravikumar said the BJP-led Union government instead of brushing aside the findings and declaring that the study was an attempt to tarnish the image of the country globally must take concrete action to set right the inequality.

New Zealand finished first in the index for the second consecutive year. Portugal recorded its best showing by securing second place (up from 5th place in 2022) followed by the Netherlands in the third place.

Iran was placed at the bottom of the global list. Yemen, which has been devastated by the Saudi-led invasion performed poorly followed by the Comoros Islands, a former French colony located off the southeastern coast of Africa.

OBI has been publishing the inclusiveness index from 2016 ranking the countries by their levels of inclusion using a number of indicators. This year for the first time, OBI included an indicator for a country's response to the climate crisis by considering its change in greenhouse gas emissions.",2023-11-10T12:21:46Z
The Times of India,Stubble Burning Cases Down By 70% In Up: Min | Lucknow News - Times of India,,"Lucknow: A day after the Supreme Court pulled up Delhi, Punjab, UP and Rajasthan governments over incidents of stubble burning leading to air pollution in Delhi, state agriculture minister Surya Pratap Shahi on Wednesday maintained that the menace has been brought down by almost 70% as compared to last year.

Stating that the air pollution issue in Delhi cannot be turned into a political debate, the apex court had pointed out how children in the national capital are going through health issues because of the pollution.

""We do not care how you do it... it must stop. Whether sometimes by forceful actions and sometimes by incentives,"" the top court had remarked.

Shahi maintained that the state government was committed to abide by the SC order, but the fact remains that nothing can happen overnight.

""It will take some time. We are penalizing the violators and incentivizing stubble management. At the same time, concerted steps were being taken to educate the farmers and make them more and more aware,"" he said while speaking to TOI.

He said that the state government has been apprising the court about the steps taken for stubble management. ""UP is the least problematic state and the court does acknowledge this,"" Shahi said.

The minister said that the state government plans to increase its focus on incentivizing stubble management with the help of dedicated Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs). He said that compressed Biogas plants using stubble have already been set up in Gorakhpur and Badaun.

The one in Gorakhpur is being set up by Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) while the Badaun plant has been set up by BPCL. For this, the state government has given equipment to the FPOs at heavily subsidized rates to dispose of stubble efficiently.

Agriculture department officials said that the incidents of stubble burning dropped from just over 3,000 cases in 2022 to a little under 1,000 cases until October this year in UP.

According to figures released by the Centre last week during the 45 days period of the current paddy harvesting season (September 15 to October 29), a total stubble burning incidents in Haryana, Punjab, NCR - UP, NCR- Rajasthan and Delhi have come down from 13,964 in the corresponding period in 2022 to 6,391 this year - that is a reduction of around 54%. Records show that in 2021 11,461 incidents of stubble burning were reported. This way, the incidents went up between 2021 and 2022.

The ministry of environment and climate change had stated that a series of interventions by various stakeholders including frequent review and daily monitoring have resulted in bringing down stubble burning incidents significantly in the last two years.",2023-11-09T03:54:27Z
Hindustan Times,Pune reports spike in flu cases,,"Pune: City doctors have witnessed a significant two-fold increase in influenza infections, with symptoms like fever and persistent cough. Since last month the flu infection observed in patients is more virulent than reported in previous months with delay in recovery, claim doctors.

Doctors attribute the surge in cases to weather change and rising pollution. Most of the patients with respiratory infections have influenza and influenza-like illness (ILI). Number of patients with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) has also increased with some requiring hospitalisation.

However, hardly anyone gets tested for influenza virus or Covid, doctors said.

Dr Avinash Bhondwe, senior physician, said, ""The rise in cases has been reported for the past three weeks. Now we receive 14-15 patients daily as compared to 4-5 reported last month. Most of the symptoms subside quickly, but the cough is persistent for a longer duration than one week to two weeks. The trend of long-lasting cough is more given the pollution and climate change.""

Dr Bhagwan Pawar, Pune Municipal Corporation health officer, said, ""The spurt in cases is probably because of erratic weather conditions. Most are flu-like illnesses with hardly any report of Covid-19, H3N2 and H1N1 patients in the city. The severity of flu cases is not too much.""

Dr Rajesh Karyakarte, head, microbiology department at BJ Medical College and Sassoon General Hospital, said, ""Across the state, the number of Covid cases has declined. There are hardly a few samples of Covid-19 patients that we get for conducting genomic sequencing. The last variant of Covid-19 was mild in nature and given the mass immunisation, people infected with the virus develops mild symptoms. Hence, many infected patients even don't get tested for Covid-19.""",2023-11-05T00:30:07Z

The discovery has been published in New Zealand-based international journal Zootaxa.

ZSI scientists in Kolkata, in collaboration with their counterparts at Kalyani University and Alexander Koenig Leibniz Institute, Germany, made the discovery.""During the Durga Puja season, Debika Bhunia, Devanshu Gupta, Subhankar Sarkar and Dirk Ahrens discovered a new phytophagous beetle species in Behala. It's been preserved at ZSI's national zoological collection, like an unpolished diamond. The discovery may lead to more findings related to its role in agriculture and other disciplines,"" said ZSI director Dhriti Banerjee. ""This was ZSI's festive gift to the people of Kolkata -- a beetle, named after the city itself."" Black or grey in colour, Maladera Kolkataensis is usually encrusted in dirt. Its bumpy appearance is distinct, with short, dense setae all over the body, and a scientific eye is needed for accurate recognition.

ZSI reported 20 more new records from other areas of Bengal and Bihar. Banerjee said, ""Biodiversity is all but lost or dwindling, claimed by some. The new species have rekindled our hope in the evolving biosphere. The concerted effort and measures taken by the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEFCC) are bearing fruits.""

Biodiversity studies, the ZSI director said, were relevant in today's economic context, as Bengal and Bihar were part of the lower Gangetic plains, an epicentre of the Indian agricultural zone. ""This specific type of beetle feeds on different parts of plants, although there is no proven study yet on it being a farm pest. But there's no denying its close relatives destroy crops, food and livestock,"" Banerjee said.

Tracing the Maladera Kolkataensis to entomofauna (the fauna of insects or the insects of a particular environment or region) would further strengthen the faunistic and taxonomic knowledge of the group, Banerjee said. ""My PhD student Bhunia and I have described 11 new species of this particular group of beetles,"" said Devanshu Gupta, ZSI scientist and officer-in-charge of Coleoptera section.

Hindustan Times,"Option for Quad Summit on Jan 27 remains on table, focus on maritime security",,"New Delhi: The option for the leaders of the Quad, which groups India, Australia, Japan and the US, holding a summit in New Delhi in January remains on the table and all the countries are working on a list of deliverables in areas such as technology and infrastructure, people familiar with the matter said.

Australia and Japan have shown flexibility about the holding of the Quad Summit early next year because both India and the US are set to go into general elections, which will sharply reduce the window for such a meeting, the people, familiar with discussions on the issue, said on condition of anonymity.

The holding of the summit will be contingent on US President Joe Biden accepting the Indian government's invitation to be chief guest at the Republic Day celebrations on January 26. US ambassador Eric Garcetti said in September that Biden has been invited by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to be the chief guest, though the US administration is yet to formally announce its acceptance.

Provided Biden goes ahead with a visit to India next year, the date being considered for the Quad Summit is January 27, the people said. A meeting over the weekend is being considered because Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will be busy with Australia Day on January 26, while his Japanese counterpart Fumio Kishida will be tied up with a session of the Diet or Japan's Parliament. The Diet's session is expected to begin on either January 15 or January 22, and the convention is that the premier cannot be absent during proceedings.

People familiar with preparations in Australia and Japan said the leaders of both countries would be willing to fly to India after concluding their official engagements on January 26 for the Quad Summit.

""We are willing to be flexible as we know that the window for the meeting is limited, since the Indian side will go into election mode by February or March and then the same thing will happen in the US,"" one of the people said.

Several working groups under the Quad framework have continued their work in areas ranging from critical and emerging technologies to health and climate change to put together a list of deliverables for the proposed summit. These groups are building on decisions announced at the third in-person Quad Summit in Hiroshima in May.

""All the countries have their own priorities, but the focus is expected to be on critical and emerging technologies, infrastructure, maritime security, health security and critical minerals,"" a second person said.

Much of the Quad's work since its revival in 2017 has concentrated on ensuring the Indo-Pacific remains peaceful, stable, secure and prosperous and that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries is respected in the face of China's aggressive behaviour across the region.

At the last summit, the Quad countries issued a statement of principles on clean energy supply chains to back a sustainable and inclusive clean energy transition. For this, the four countries are working with Indo-Pacific partners to facilitate research and feasibility studies to lower the costs of clean energy manufacturing and to enhance regional energy security.

The Quad also announced at the last summit that its vaccine partnership would change into a broader health security partnership that will strengthen coordination for health security in the Indo-Pacific. This includes building capacity to detect and respond to potential epidemics and pandemics.",2023-11-03T13:30:56Z

The Times of India,"Winged Guests Arrive Early At Rabindra Sarobar, Species Count Already At 110 | Kolkata News - Times of India",Subhro Niyogi,"Kolkata: An unusually large number of migratory birds have arrived at Rabindra Sarobar this season, raising hopes of a record turnout this year. Not only have migratory birds reached the lake early, many have stayed back longer than usual, much to the delight of birders who are flocking there in huge numbers.

Last year, 118 bird specieshad been recorded at Rabindra Sarobar.The year prior to that, 116 bird species had been recorded. This year, with two months still to go, the count has already touched 110.

The bird species recorded include the square-tailed drongo cuckoo that has been spotted for the first time. The hooded pitta that was sighted only once earlier for only a day seven-eight years ago, that too fleetingly as it had stayed for only a day, was around for two weeks this October.

""For bird lovers, it has been a great year so far. Apart from the square-tailed drongo cuckoo, five other birds have been sighted for the first time -- the yellow bittern, Blyth's pipit, Siberian blue robin, pin-tailed snipe and pied thrush. Till October 25 this year, we have spotted 108 bird species at the lake,"" said Mitali Deb, the medical superintendent at Jadavpur University, who went to Rabindra Sarobar every day during Durga Puja to click photographs of the large number of birds.

Other birds that have been spotted at the Lake in the past month-and-a-half include the scaly thrush, ultramarine flycatcher, Indian blue robin, Indian pitta, greenish warbler, paradise flycatcher, lesser cuckoo, Indian cuckoo, dark-sided flycatcher, rusty-tailed flycatcher, Asian brown flycatcher, brown-breasted flycatcher, chestnut-winged cuckoo and blue-capped rock thrush.

Techie Sudip Ghosh, who has been birding at Sarobar for over 13 years, said he had never seen so many birds arrive at the lake this early. ""The arrival of birds usually starts around September end or early October. But this year, the birds have arrived at least two weeks early. And different species have continued to fly in, keeping us hooked,"" he said.

Bird experts said extreme events, like the cloudburst in Sikkim due to climate change, may have triggered the early migration. Others felt the conservation of a habitat at the safari park in Rabindra Sarobar and curbs on Chhath festival at the lake where a large number of crackers used to be burst had contributed towards turning the Lake into a safe haven for the winged guests.

The lesser cuckoo was spotted for a month instead of one day earlier and the Indian pitta that used to stay for two-three days was here for a month. The ultramarine flycatcher that used to be here for barely two-three days was spotted over a fortnight. A number of painted storks have also arrived at the islands, as have oriental darters.

""We have spotted at least four couples who have nested and have had offspring. Usually, they used to nest at the Alipore zoo,"" said Deb.",2023-11-01T03:10:49Z

Over 1,000 trees, most of which are over 100 years old, on the both sides of NH 17 from Guwahati to Goalpara have been marked by the highway authorities to upgrade the road from two lanes to four.

Adil Hussain, in a Facebook live on Thursday after he returned to home in Goalpara in Assam from Delhi on Wednesday, said he was pained at the move to cut down the trees for the sake of development. ""I have visited around 60 countries till date. These countries are far more developed than India. Roads are good there. They do not get damaged for years. In India, rainfall is an excuse behind the damage of roads every year. Excess rainfall happens in Europe too, but roads do not get damaged.""

He said the first-world countries also carry out developmental work but without harming nature. He added that there is accountability of the authorities in the developed countries. ""They love nature. They love trees, rivers, wetlands and protect them and at the same time they also construct roads and bridges,"" he added.

He said the authorities here can also protect those 100-year-old trees and expand the highway. ""The project cost may increase to some extent but it will protect nature,"" he added. ""Every time I travel from LGBI Airport in Guwahati to Goalpara via Mirza, Chhaygaon, Boko, Dhupdhara, Dudhnoi, Krishnai and Agia through NH 17, the scenic beauty touches my heart and makes me feel at peace. I cannot imagine my journey without these trees along the highway,"" he added.

Filmmaker Rima Das said most of the trees are over 100 years old. ""Will planting saplings in replacement of these aged trees compensate for the loss? Planting saplings is not enough. It takes years for saplings to grow into trees. And we all know about the impact of global warming. Therefore, it is my request to the state government and the authorities concerned to protect the trees,"" she added.

Meanwhile, the sources of highway authorities said they have got due permission from the authorities concerned and there is a system of compensatory afforestation which is initiated by the forest department.",2023-10-28T03:40:47Z

The officials said they had prepared plans to utilise the funds and will float tenders as soon as they get sanction for the grant.

During a meeting via video conferencing of all urban local bodies which were granted funds under NCAP, MC commissioner Sandeep Rishi on Friday asked the central government officials to issue the grant to the civic body, so that they could continue with their measures. Rishi blamed the ongoing construction works for little improvement in air quality and assured them to use funds as soon as possible. The MC had received around Rs 91 crore from the Centre under this scheme, utilising at least 66% of the amount on various works.

An MC official, on the condition of anonymity, said the elevated road project is underway on Ferozepur road for a long time. He said air pollution monitoring system is installed on Ferozepur road outside PAU and readings can never be correct, he added. He said some other works are also going on, so it is difficult to bring desired improvement in air quality. He claimed funds could not be used completely because of delay in tenders, but now they have decided to convert the funds for similar nature of works.

Rishi said, ""We have requested release of grants under NCAP. Previous funds will be utilised shortly as tenders have been received now."" He said there is no dearth of development works, but the tendering process is tedious.

The Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change had launched the National Clean Air Programme on January 10, 2019 to improve the air quality in 131 cities in 24 states in the country. It aims to achieve a PM10 level up to 40%, or the achievement of National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) by 2025-26.

The Times of India, Mastering the art of strategic thinking and becoming an effective board | India News - Times of India,"TIMESOFINDIA COM, Updated Oct","NEW DELHI: In today's fast-paced and ever-evolving business landscape, mastering the art of strategic thinking and becoming an effective board member is more critical than ever. Corporate leaders and decision-makers are continually challenged to navigate complex challenges, conflicts, and crises, making the need for strategic leadership skills and effective governance practices all the more evident.

Historical Evolution of Corporate Boards

To truly master the art of strategic thinking, one must first understand the historical evolution of corporate boards. Corporate boards have undergone significant transformations over the years, adapting to the changing needs of businesses. From their humble beginnings as advisory councils to the influential governing bodies they are today, boards have played a pivotal role in shaping the direction of companies.

The Nuances of Board-CEO Relationships

One key aspect of mastering strategic thinking and effective board membership is understanding the nuances of board-CEO relationships. The relationship between a company's board and its CEO is central to its success. Common causes of conflict between boards and executives can include differences in vision, strategy, and decision-making. However, learning how to manage and enhance this relationship is essential for any corporate leader.

Corporate Controls, Risk, and Strategy

Effective boards are also well-versed in making financial controls ""board friendly"" and actively participating in shaping company strategy. Risk management is a crucial aspect of board responsibilities, and understanding how to structure a board for smart risk oversight is essential. Strategic thinking extends to the ability to evaluate company strategy critically and contribute to its development.

Information Management and New Director Onboarding

Boards need to prioritize and utilize board information effectively. The quality and relevance of information provided to the board can significantly impact decision-making. In addition, preparing new board members for their roles is vital to ensuring that they can contribute effectively from day one. Onboarding programs play a critical role in this process.

Specialized Governance Insights

Different types of organizations have specific governance needs. Family businesses, joint ventures, subsidiaries, and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) each come with their unique governance challenges. Learning how to address these needs is essential for mastering board membership.

Conflict Resolution and Crisis Management

Mastering the art of strategic thinking also includes proficiency in conflict resolution and crisis management. Boardroom conflicts can arise from various sources, and it's vital to know how to handle them effectively. Being prepared for board crises is part of a board member's role.

Environmental and Social Responsibility

In today's world, environmental and social responsibility are integral to corporate governance. Boards play a crucial role in addressing climate change risks and advancing sustainability. Understanding the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors and their impact on business is essential for modern board members.

The Times of India,'Pernem students to help document local biodiversity' | Goa News - Times of India,Oct,"Panaji: Tracking of biodiversity in Pernem will be carried out through a competition among school students, the Goa board of secondary and higher secondary education (GBSHSE) has said in a circular. Earlier, school teachers were given training on how to document the neighbourhood biodiversity, which will aid in updating the people's biodiversity register of every village in the taluka with the help of students.

""During the upcoming holidays, the students can document various flora and fauna in their villages and subsequently after the Diwali holidays submit their entries to Track Change LLP, Ponda, Goa. After thorough evaluation, a programme will be held and prizes will be given to the best documentation and photographs,"" the board stated.

The board has also stated that the programme will help inculcate environmental awareness and sustainability among students.

In 2021, an MoU was signed between the Goa state biodiversity board (GSBB) and the GBSHSE. Schools were informed then that Class10 and 9 students will participate in surveys and research projects in their school area to learn about biodiversity and climate change.

The Goa board said that the MoU was signed with the objective of spreading awareness among students about biodiversity and its importance for human well-being. ""Students and teachers will be able to help the statutory biodiversity management committees (BMCs) under the Biodiversity Act, 2002 in their village panchayats or municipalities and other areas through this initiative of the board,"" the circular to schools states.

""Goa board will also assist GSBB through their teachers and students in their field work and/or research work as and when mutually decided, in the preparation of people's biodiversity register and other biodiversity related projects and initiatives,"" the circular further states.

Currently, Delhi government provides multiple subsidies on the purchase of electric vehicles -- road tax waiver, purchase incentives of up to ₹30,000 for two-wheelers, up to ₹5,500 for e-cycles, up to ₹30,000 on e-rickshaws and light commercial vehicles.

Around 11% of all vehicles sold in Delhi currently are electric vehicles, the official said. ""Currently, Delhi has roughly around 4,500 private and public EV charging points,"" the official said explaining the reasons behind quick adoption of such vehicles in Delhi.

Earlier, the Delhi government officials said that the framing of the new policy was delayed because the lieutenant governor's office terminated 400 ""specialists"" who were working in the EV cell, the nodal centre to implement EV policy. However, the LG's office said that the specialists were terminated because they were hired in a ""non-transparent manner"" and without the mandatory approvals of the competent authority.

Amit Bhatt, managing director (India), International Council on Clean Transportation , said, ""The Delhi EV policy has brought a revolution in the adoption of electric vehicles, not only in Delhi but across the entire country. Therefore, the continuation of this EV policy is crucial to maintain the momentum in favour of EVs. It will be essential to monitor the specific details of the new policy as it takes shape. The inclusion of trucks and other freight vehicles holds the potential to usher in a new era of decarbonising the transport sector, in which Delhi can take a leading role.""

Launched on October 22, 2020, the Delhi Electric Vehicle Policy -- one of the flagship plans of Delhi's Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government -- was aimed at fighting high levels of air pollution in the city by cutting vehicular emissions. The policy sought to achieve this objective by bringing about a paradigm shift in the Capital's transport sector by introducing two key changes. One, the state government embarked on a major switch from Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)-run public buses to electric buses. Of the total 3,700 buses run by the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC), the Capital now has 800 electric buses. And, the government has committed to buy only electric buses to replace the CNG ones that will be retired from the fleet.

The second major change was encouraging residents to switch to electric vehicles by providing subsidies. The policy has set a target of 25% of all new vehicles registered in Delhi to be electric by 2025.",2023-10-23T19:03:37Z

The Times of India,Govt not capable of acting against dance bars: Lobo | Goa News - Times of India,Oct,"Calangute: If the authorities of the densely populated city of Mumbai could stop thousands of dance bars overnight, why can't it be done in Calangute, a local citizens' group said on Friday, referring to the alleged dance bars and cheating of tourists by touts in the bustling North Goa coastal village.

""It appears that the Goa government is incapable of handling these problems,"" Calangute Constituency Forum (CCF) president Premanand Divkar said.

He further said that CCF has impressed upon panchayat members to take steps to conserve the village's biodiversity and eco-sensitive areas so as to minimise the impact of climate change. ""Calangute was a world-famous village filled with greenery. Now all that has been taken over by big resorts and building projects and attention has shifted to the fields and hills,"" he said.

Divkar pointed out that the WRD has recently started work on a water storage facility in the fields at Boa Viagem, which is likely to embolden others. ""If the government does fills fields, even if it is in public interest, people think it is OK if they do it too,"" he said.",2023-10-22T23:28:45Z

Hindustan Times,Set up 35-ft tall sheets at construction sites: BMC,,"Mumbai: The deteriorating air quality in Mumbai over the last two weeks has driven the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to take steps to mitigate dust pollution from construction sites, road works and refineries. Currently, construction is underway at 6,000 locations across Mumbai.

At a joint review meeting of multiple agencies and various developer bodies on Friday, civic chief Iqbal Singh Chahal listed out a stringent list of dos and don'ts for developers to follow. Key mandates are to enclose all under-construction buildings in an area of one acre or more with 35-feet high iron or cloth sheets and installing sprinklers at all sites within 15 days, and smog gun system within a month.

""BMC will leave no stone unturned to curb air pollution in Mumbai,"" Chahal told HT after the meeting.

Additionally, restrictions have been put on entry of diesel-run vehicles older than the prescribed limit; it will be inspected through state transport department. All 50 to 60 major roads will be micro-sprayed with smog guns early morning and be inspected by special teams. Instructions were also given by Chahal for review of air quality in the vicinity of refineries, especially Mahul.

Chahal emphasised that all circulars issued on April 1 be stringently implemented and a new set of guidelines will be announced on October 22. He warned that private and government constructions will be stopped if the instructions are flouted.

While he acknowledged that construction business is a major push for the economy, he said as dust pollution is an unavoidable outcome, all government agencies must coordinate with each other. Even Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has been directed to meet other corporations and related organisations to speed up measures.

MPCB and BMC will depute experts to verify pollution levels caused by refineries, Tata Power Plant and RCF, and check if their installations comply with the standards of pollution control measures. Random samples will be collected by the experts from these installations regularly and chemically analysed to ensure that no pollution is caused by these plants.

50 squads in 24 administrative wards shall make surprise visits to all construction sites every day to ensure compliance and shoot live videos. If any deficiency is found, construction will be stopped and a notice issued on the spot.

Chahal held the joint meeting with CREDAI, MCHI, NAREDCO, PEATA and all relevant departments of BMC along with MMRDA, MHADA, SRA, MMRCL and MIDC. The meeting was also attended by Vikas Kharge, additional municipal commissioner, Ashwini Bhide, principal secretary, Praveen Darade, department of environment and climate change, P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner(projects), Ashwini Joshi and many other bureaucrats.",2023-10-21T01:47:21Z
Hindustan Times,BMC's toothless mandate to mitigate air pollution exposed; only 4 wards comply,,"Mumbai: The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had set up a task force in March this year to mitigate air pollution. To achieve this objective, it asked ward officers to submit reports on punitive actions taken against people or agencies contributing to air pollution every 15 days to the environment department. Over six months later, as Mumbai is facing poor air quality again, the civic body has learnt that only four of the 24 wards have carried out the mandate since April and submitted the reports.

Earlier this year, the air quality had deteriorated for three months, hovering between poor and very poor levels. At the time environmentalists had attributed the pollution levels to large-scale construction being carried out for infrastructure projects, residential and commercial towers, and redevelopments old buildings, in addition to emissions from vehicular exhaust and resuspension of road dust.

To alleviate the crisis, the civic body had constituted a seven-member committee headed by the then additional municipal commissioner Dr Sanjeev Kumar to find solutions. The committee submitted a 41-page report titled 'Mumbai's Air Pollution Mitigation Plan' to civic chief Iqbal Chahal and prepared SOPs to combat air pollution, which came into effect from April 1.

As part of these SOPs, a three-level task force was to be formed at every ward comprising of eight different departments. They were authorised to take speedy action on builders by issuing warning and stop work notices on construction activities in case of non-compliance. A report on action taken was to be submitted weekly to the assistant commissioners of the respective wards and once fifteen days, they were to be sent to BMC's environment department, including the additional commissioner.

The four wards that have followed the rules are: P North ward (Malad east and west), K west ward (Jogeshwari west, Andheri west and Vile Parle west), H West ward (Bandra west, Khar west, Santacruz west) and L ward (Chandivali, Sakinaka, etc). ""We have been sending regular reminders to the wards to comply and send us the report regularly but only four have sent it,"" said Minesh Pimpale, deputy municipal commissioner, of the environment department.

So why have the other wards failed to comply with the rules?

Ward officers - that have both followed and flouted - are of the opinion that the SOPs formed by the committee to mitigate air pollution is ""responsibility without any authority"". A ward officer requesting anonymity, said, ""The laws for penal action in the SOPs are very unclear. There had to be clarity on which sections an FIR or threatening clauses can be filed, or when stringent action can be taken."" He explained, while in the case of an illegal encroachment, there are clear guidelines on action, the same is unclear in the SOPs to combat air pollution.

Another ward officer said, ""We only have powers to inspect and none to take stringent action. We are supposed to report violations to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB). Thereafter, the procedure to take action on them is different.""

Meanwhile, two ward officers who are part of the task force, said they are overworked with other responsibilities as well. ""Some of the members of the task force are the same engineers who also look after routine work. We also participated in many initiatives taken up by the chief minister, such as cleanliness drive, action on illegal hoardings, etc. So, it is difficult to monitor and submit report this frequently,"" he said.

The task force which was to be formed at every ward is also supposed to monitor construction sites, hotels and residential areas. Each team has to report to the respective ward officer.

The committee's objective was to identify the reasons for the high degree of pollution enveloping the city and suggest measures to curb it. In the course of preparing the report, it was learnt that ongoing infrastructure projects such as metro, roads, storm water drains, coastal roads, STPs, etc are polluting the air. The committee proposed to devise a monitoring mechanism for various ongoing projects.

An official in the environment department said, ""After the SOPs were formed, the AQI improved - there was clean air during the monsoons, hence the wards did not follow it. We are working at various levels including implementation of climate action plan so this will be resolved very soon.""",2023-10-20T00:31:00Z

The National Coastal Zone Management Authority (NCZMA) has directed all states to complete their 2019 coastal plans by October 31. The authority further stated that if the CZMP 2019 is not submitted before the deadline, no project should be considered for CRZ clearance as per the CRZ notification, 2011.

Goa had entrusted the task of preparing the CZMP 2011 to the National Centre for Sustainable Coastal Management (NCSCM). The NCSCM submitted the CZMP 2011 on a scale of 1:25,000.

""The NCSCM has failed to provide the correct CZMP 2011 (1:4,000 scale) as well as the hard copies till date,"" stated director of environment and climate change Levinson Martins in the letter to the Centre.

The Times of India, Climate Negotiation: Deadlock on Loss and Damage Fund as developing countries resist move on housing it in the World Bank | India News - Times of India,Vishwa Mohan,"NEW DELHI: Negotiations by countries at the fourth and final meeting of the UN Transitional Committee on Loss and Damage in Aswan, Egypt, hit a deadlock on its penultimate day on Thursday with climate negotiating groups of developing countries objecting move of developed countries' negotiators who pushed for housing the new proposed fund in the World Bank.

Different views on other related issues also blocked a concrete decision on the Fund that is scheduled to be operationalised based on final call taken at the upcoming UN climate conference in Dubai during November 30-December 12. Besides location, other issues include governance arrangements of the fund and sources of funding (expanding the donor base that may include India and China) and eligibility for beneficiaries.

The Transitional Committee mandated with designing the new Loss and Damage Fund has now only a day left to formally conclude the talks. The Fund will be meant to support vulnerable countries who faced the climate change-induced disasters.

Sources and civil society groups privy to the discussion said that the countries remained divergent on fundamental issues to operationalize the Loss and Damage fund.

""Developed countries, led by the United States, have insisted that the new Loss and Damage Fund should be set up under the World Bank as a host financial intermediary fund (FIF). Under such an arrangement, the World Bank would set up the Secretariat and provide related Secretariat services for the new fund against a fee and following the conclusion of a negotiated agreement,"" said the Climate Action Network (CAN) -- a global network of over 1900 civil society organisations in over 130 countries including India.

Developing countries during the negotiations are, however, learnt to have resisted the move of developed nations as they believe that it would restrict access to and the legal independence, flexibility and decision-making power of the new fund.

Pedro L Pedroso Cuesta, Chair of the Group of the 77 and China expressed concerns during the meet about the inability of a fund under the World Bank to provide legal independence, legal personality, accountability to the Conference of Parties (COP) and respond with speed to emergency event.

""During this critical meeting on loss and damage finance, it's alarming to witness wealthy countries cunningly maneuvering to significantly narrow the scope of the new Loss and Damage Fund. This move sidelines hundreds of millions of vulnerable people worldwide. While claiming to prioritise small island states and the least developed countries, these rich nations aim to fracture the unity of developing countries,"" said Harjeet Singh, Head of Global Political Strategy, Climate Action Network International.

He said, ""Furthermore, the push for the World Bank's involvement as a host of the Loss and Damage Fund -- an entity notorious for exacerbating crises and perpetuating global inequality -- is starkly inappropriate. Its track record of prioritizing shareholders over the disenfranchised is telling. Wealthy nations must confront their longstanding inaction and acknowledge their significant role in the current climate crisis. The world is watching, and history will remember those who obstruct progress.""

Brandon Wu, Director of Policy & Campaigns, ActionAid USA, said, ""It's outrageous that the United States and other developed countries are insisting that the Loss & Damage Fund must be housed within the World Bank, rather than established as a new independent entity. Putting the Fund in the World Bank feels like a cynical way of making the Fund more palatable to the US interests rather than ensuring it is designed to serve impacted communities in developing countries.

""There are many reasons that the World Bank is a nonstarter as a host for the Loss & Damage Fund. The L&D Fund should have direct access, equitable governance, be fully grant-based, and be innovative and fit-for-purpose. The World Bank would present major obstacles to all of these. We call on the United States to step back from its insistence on the World Bank and ensure that the L&D Fund is designed primarily with the needs of recipient countries, not those of the contributors, in mind.""",2023-10-19T15:59:44Z

The Times of India,Indian agricultural sector on the verge of the 4th wave of revolution,Dr Prashant Prabhakar Deshpande,"Dr. Prashant Prabhakar Deshpande has post-graduated in Economics with a Gold Medal in 1976 and was awarded a Ph.D in Social Sciences from Nagpur University in 2007.

Agriculture plays a significant role in India's economic growth. With around 54.6% of the total workforce involved in agriculture and allied sector activities, the sector contributes 17.8% to the country's Gross Value Added (GVA). During 2021-22, in the country's total exports agricultural exports contributed of to the tune of US $ 50.2 billion with a 20% increase from US $ 41.3 billion in 2020-21. In FY 2023, it is projected that the Indian agriculture sector will grow at the rate 3.5%.

The use of conventional farming methods in India had traditionally led to comparatively less improvement in efficiency and agricultural yields resulting in low productivity of agriculture. Taking note of this, the government has initiated the 4 wave of revolution in the agricultural sector to introduce technological advancement in the sector to improve yields.

India's agricultural sector today is said to be on the verge of a breakthrough technological transformation. After decades of evolution, starting from Mechanisation and the Green Revolution, disruptive technologies are said to have ushered in Precision Agriculture. The new farm management approach uses Geopolitical Systems (GPS) and Artificial Intelligence-enabled software for precise mapping of farmlands, ensuring that individual fields or crops get precisely the inputs they need for optimum productivity.

Agriculture 4.0 is said to be a considerably advanced version of precision farming methods with the potential to transform the existing methods of farming. Precision farming focuses on a comprehensive approach towards maintaining the well-being of the field and the soil with a focus on improving the quality and quantity of yield with minimum environmental harm according to experts.

The idea of 4 Revolution in agriculture according to experts involves:

According to experts, Precision farming has the potential to transform the conventional farming industry. While the Conventional farming practices control watering of crops and spraying pesticides or fertilisers uniformly across the field, the farmers under Precision farming will need to be more targeted and data-driven in the context of farming according to them.

Future farms therefore will be more productive according to experts owing to:

These cutting-edge methods will improve farm profitability, efficiency, safety, and environmental friendliness according to them. These together are referred to as advanced or high-tech precision farming.

Prospects of Indian Agriculture

The continuous technological innovation in the Indian agriculture sector can play a critical role in the growth and development of the sector crucial for ensuring:

Various Constraints to the achievement of this goal include:

These constraints, generating unpredictable weather patterns, present a significant barrier to India's agriculture to growing sustainably and profitably according to experts.

Under these circumstances, the future of agriculture seems to depend on the involvement of much-developed technologies like robotics, temperature and moisture sensors, aerial images, and GPS technology. Use of these, in the opinion of experts will make farms more productive, efficient, safe, and environmentally sustainable owing to the cutting-edge equipment, robotic systems, and precision agriculture.

India's agriculture mainly depends on the nature. However changing climate and global warming are making farming unpredictable. The need to use modern technologies to increase productivity and profitability has therefore led to the adoption of Agriculture 4.0 in India.

There have been significant changes in India in the context of agriculture over the decades with development of many new technologies. Several new-age farmers are now using soil mapping software to determine the optimum level of fertilizers used in the farms.

Application of these emerging technologies in farming and agriculture has paved the way for more opportunities. The Agro-tech Start-ups and traditional farmers are now said to be using the latest solutions and trends to improve production in the food value chain, including the adoption of new technologies, such as cloud-based solutions which offer widespread access to weather forecasts and other critical information and other relevant advanced agricultural management techniques to increase farmer efficiency and produce more crops.

Some Examples include:

Emerging trends in the agricultural sector that are quite prominent in the post-liberalization era include increased production, increased investment, diversification of the sector, use of modern techniques, development of horticulture and floriculture, increasing volume of exports and development of the food processing industry.

The farmers must advantage of these technologies to productivity on their farms.",2023-10-16T08:48:21Z
Hindustan Times,Record spike in aerosol in Hindu Kush region: Study,,"New Delhi: The Hindu Kush-Himalaya-Tibetan Plateau region has been witnessing an alarming increase in aerosol levels that could be driving increased temperatures, altering rainfall patterns, accelerating glacier retreat and initiating changes in the hydrological cycle in the region, a new analysis by the Indian Space Research Organisation's (Isro) Physical Research Laboratory has shown.

The study, the first of its kind, used ground-based observations, satellite data, and simulations, to assess aerosol characteristics and radiative forcing -- the change in energy flux in the atmosphere caused by natural or anthropogenic factors of climate -- in several locations in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP), the Himalayan foothills and the Tibetan Plateau. Data shows that the aerosol radiative forcing efficiency (ARFE) -- which shows the effect of anthropogenic aerosols on the radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere -- was significantly higher in the Himalayan foothills.

""The mean ARFE is two to four times higher here than over other polluted sites in south and east Asia, owing to higher AOD (aerosol optical depth) and aerosol absorption. Further, the observed annual mean aerosol-induced atmospheric heating rates (0.5-0.8 Kelvin/day), which are significantly higher than previously reported values for the region, imply that the aerosols alone could account for over 50% of the total warming, including aerosols and greenhouse gases, of the lower atmosphere and surface over this region,"" the study said.

Researchers also highlighted that the current models used in climate assessments in the region ""significantly underestimate"" aerosol-induced heating, efficiency and warming over the Hindu Kush-Himalaya-Tibetan Plateau region, indicating the need for a more realistic representation of aerosol properties.

""The significant, regionally coherent aerosol-induced warming that we observe in the high altitudes of the region, is a significant factor contributing to increasing air temperature, observed accelerated retreat of the glaciers, and changes in the hydrological cycle and precipitation patterns over this region. Thus, aerosols are heating up the Himalayan climate, and will remain a key factor driving climate change over the region,"" the study added.

The Hindu Kush-Himalaya-Tibetan Plateau region contains the largest ice mass outside Antarctic and Arctic polar regions, and has witnessed a pronounced retreat in glaciers, which also feed into most major rivers of Asia.

A 2019 report by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) found that the Hindu Kush Himalayas are warming faster than the global average, and that the consequences of it in the region were severe.

That ICIMOD report highlighted that 1.5 degrees Celsius is ""too hot"" for the Hindu Kush Himalayas.

David Molden, former director-general of ICIMOD, said that global warming of 1.5 degrees Celsius will actually mean in a 2 degrees Celsius temperature increase in the mountains.

""This would affect half the glaciers in the HKH region, destabilising Asia's rivers and endangering the lives and livelihoods of billions of people.""

The PRL study also warned of similar consequences. Researchers have also observed ice loss along the entire 2000-km transect of the Himalayas, which, they said, could be the result of direct heating of the atmosphere by aerosols.",2023-10-13T00:53:17Z

The Times of India,Panel resolves to declare ESZ around six protected areas | Bengaluru News - Times of India,Niranjan Kaggere,"BENGALURU: To safeguard protected forest areas and reduce rising incidents of human-animal conflict, the government on Wednesday resolved to declare a total of 1,961.4 sqkm around six national parks and wildlife sanctuaries as eco-sensitive zones (ESZ).

A cabinet sub-committee headed by forest minister Eshwar Khandre, which met in Bengaluru, made the decision and a memorandum will soon be submitted to the cabinet for recommendation to the Centre for final notification.

The six protected areas include Rajiv Gandhi National Park at Nagarahole (Mysuru district); Anshi National Park and Dandeli Wildlife Sanctuary (Uttara Kannada-Belagavi); Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuary (Chamarajanagar and Ramanagara); Kappatagudda Wildlife Sanctuary (Gadag); Bukkapatna Chinkara Wildlife Sanctuary (Tumakuru) and Kammasandra Wildlife Sanctuary (Kolar).

The decision was based on a Supreme Court direction in the TN Godavarman vs Union of India case way back in 2011 which ruled that every national park or wildlife sanctuary should have an ESZ of a minimum of 1km where developmental activities shall be regulated or prohibited. The ministry of environment, forests and climate change was asked to draw up detailed guidelines.

Khandre said, ""We deliberated threadbare every protected area that was placed before the committee and made a recommendation accordingly.""",2023-10-12T07:50:07Z
The Times of India,Train Forest Officers At Judicial Academies: Hc | Nagpur News - Times of India,Vaibhav Ganjapure,"Nagpur: Censuring forest officers for lapses in investigations into killing of wild animals, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court stressed on providing proper training to them through academies like Judicial Officers Training Institute (JOTI), and Maharashtra Judicial Academy (MJA), which provide training to judges.

""The crimes of killing of wild animals are on the rise and it directly results in affecting the ecological balance. These are generally committed for economic or financial gain, and in some cases, the crime syndicate is involved. Training is necessary for forest officers, who are required to conduct the investigation at ground level and particularly for the competent ones authorized under law to record the confessional statement,"" justice Govinda Sanap said.

Accused Yogesh Kumbhare and others had challenged their conviction under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, first by JMFC Sakoli and then by the Bhandara sessions court, for allegedly hunting two chitals and eating their meat at Nagzira on August 16, 2005. Quoting lack of evidence, the HC quashed their six-month jail term and acquitted all five accused, while making it clear that their confessional statements cannot be used as evidence.

Emphasizing that the investigation of wildlife crime requires training as well as efforts to harness the skills, the judge said the best possible way is to arrange departmental workshops for forest officers.

""To take care of this important aspect, to harness investigation skills and to understand the intricacies of the law, the possibility of conducting workshops at judicial academies in Maharashtra like JOTI at Nagpur or MJA at Uttan can be explored. Such workshops can help forest officers understand the intricacies of the subject and implement the same at the time of investigation at ground level, which is the need of the hour.""

While asking HC registrar (judicial) to forward a copy of this judgment to Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (PCCF) -- Head of Forest Force (HOFF) and wildlife -- both in the city, justice Sanap said they should take necessary steps as per the court's observations.

Considering the serious lapses committed by the competent forest officers while recording confessional statements, the judge said it is necessary to direct all to take remedial steps. ""The Wildlife Crime Control Bureau of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MOEFCC) has published a handbook for wildlife crime officers. Despite its publication, there appears to be no improvement at the ground level. It appears that the investigating officers and those competent to record confessional statements are either not made aware of this handbook or they have not bothered to follow its guidelines,"" he said.",2023-10-10T03:10:40Z
Hindustan Times,"Monsoon extremes; retreating glaciers led to Sikkim disaster, say experts",,"Read here: Sikkim floods: Weather hinders rescue operations as death toll rises to 27

Extreme rainfall in Sikkim, the north Sikkim region received around 39mm between Tuesday morning and Wednesday morning, triggered flash floods and is suspected to have triggered a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) on Lhonak Lake, that has so far claimed at least 27 lives.

The sudden surge of monsoon over eastern and northeastern India at a time when monsoon is in its withdrawal phase is a continuation of the erratic season observed in the country this year.

On September 30, HT reported that monsoon 2023 has been a story of swings, and as the months progressed, the variations only became more intense: 9% deficient in June, excess by 13% in July, deficient again by 36% in August and, finally in September, excess by 13%.

In its extended range forecast on Thursday, the India Meteorological Department said that the formation of consecutive low-pressure systems this month has intensified monsoon rainfall over east, northeast and parts of peninsular India. This, the forecast said, is expected to continue until October 18.

A low-pressure area is lying over central parts of Bangladesh, and a trough is running from Nagaland to southwest Bihar across the cyclonic circulation associated with the above low-pressure area, IMD said.

""Monsoon has not withdrawn from east India yet so when weather systems develop, we can see active monsoon conditions,"" said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD.

Explaining the phenomena, Mahesh Palawat, vice president, climate and meteorology, Skymet Weather, said, ""A low-pressure area formed over the eastern parts of the country but north-westerly winds did not allow it to travel across to northwest India. Instead, it is concentrated over east India. Moisture from the Bay of Bengal is feeding this system. The low-pressure system is stagnant over the eastern parts of the country causing heavy downpour.""

Due to this low-pressure area, the withdrawal of monsoon has been delayed, Palawat said.

But the erratic monsoon alone did not cause the Lhonak lake to burst on Wednesday morning.

South Lhonak glacier is among one of the fastest retreating glaciers, and the associated proglacial lake has become the largest and fastest-growing in Sikkim.

The glacier receded nearly 2 km in the 46-year period between 1962 and 2008. It further retreated by nearly 400 m from 2008 to 2019, a paper by the Department of Geology and Environmental Geosciences, University of Dayton, said in 2021. The paper warned of the increased susceptibility of the Lhonak lake to potential avalanche impacts as the lake grows in the future.

""Hazard intensity mapping based on the GLOF scenarios considered in the study shows that many settlements along the valley, including the largest town Chungthang, are at high risk... Due to the construction of the hydropower dam at Chungthang in 2015, GLOF risk mitigation in relation to South Lhonak and other critical lakes in the basin is of utmost importance,"" the paper, published in Science Direct, said.

A GLOF is caused when the moraine (the debris accumulated over the years by a glacier) that usually functions as a dam, around the lake, is breached.

GLOFs can be triggered by extreme meteorological conditions, especially heavy rainfall events that cause degradation of the damming moraine and lead to overfilling of the lake.

And this is exactly what happened in Sikkim.

Around 1.30am on Wednesday, the overflowing Lhanak Lake burst, pushing the water downstream into the Chungthang dam, cleaving the structure, and flooding Mangan in North Sikkim, which bore the brunt of the disaster.

""We knew this was coming. We had warned the government that the breach can happen anytime for Lhonak. In this particular case it will be premature to say rainfall triggered the GLOF because we really need data of how much it rained in the higher altitudes around 5000 m above sea level where Lhonak is. Extreme rains may have triggered flash floods in Teesta for sure causing multiple disasters,"" said Anil Kulkarni, glaciologist, a distinguished scientist at the Divecha Center for Climate Change and co-author of the Lhonak paper.

But the role of climate crisis was undeniable.

""Climate crisis is impacting glaciers and we need to monitor such lakes in Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Sikkim which are all vulnerable. It's important to consider if hydropower projects should be located in these zones or you will end up losing thousands of crores in a go as we have seen for the Teesta hydropower project. I have been recommending climate assessments in addition to environment impact assessments for such projects,"" Kulkarni said.

Experts warned that the risk of such incidents will only rise as the planet continues to warm, stressing the need for proper monitoring systems.

""We all know that in the warming world, the potential of cloudbursts, extreme rains, GLOF has gone up. Ocean warming has already increased moisture levels over the region. The low-pressure area near the region further increased the moisture, paving a conducive environment for torrential rains. Moreover, we do not have high-resolution monitoring systems that could tell us what happened, how it happened, and to what extent climate change aggravated the scenario. We know the Himalayan region is prone to cloudbursts, but we cannot identify the hotspot. Thus, a proper monitoring network is the need of the hour,"" said Roxy Mathew Koll, Climate Scientist, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology in a statement on Friday.",2023-10-06T19:39:49Z
The Times of India,"Tn To Add 5,000mw Of Wind Power By The End Of 2023, Says Energy Secretary | - Times of India","TNN, Oct 6","Chennai: Tamil Nadu will add another 5,000 MW to the installed capacity of wind power in the state by the end of 2023, in a bid to regain the first spot, the state lost to Gujarat, said state energy secretary Beela Rajesh on Thursday. The state will also come up with the policy to repower the old wind turbines, she said.

On the second day of the Windergy conference and trade fair in the city, she told manufacturers of wind turbines and allied products, that of the 5,000 MW, about 4,400 MW would be installed by new private players, while 600MW will be an expansion of existing windmill owners.

Tamil Nadu currently has 10,225 MW wind energy as installed capacity. In May, Gujarat surpassed Tamil Nadu with an installed capacity of 10,890 MW. ""Wind power is a success in the state is because of people's participation. About 65% of wind energy produced is for captive use. Or it can be sold directly to other industries. Tangedco buys just 35% of wind power,"" said Rajesh official.

The official said that wind turbine manufacturers are not just doing business, but are contributing effectively to process of combating climate change. ""Suggestions from the conference to aid policy making,"" she said.

In the panel discussion that preceded, P R Muralidharan of Leap Green insisted that quick ramping up and ramping down of thermal stations and precise forecasting are some of the factors that will tap the true potential of wind energy.

UB Reddy, managing director of Enerfra Projects India, said that union ministry's repowering policy ignored the ground reality. ""Unless land-pooling is adopted, repowering of windmills in Tamil Nadu will not materialise,"" he said.

Ajay Jain, senior advisor, Corio Generation, said, offshore wind is not competing with the wind farms on land. ""In fact, both should collaborate as we are ultimately fighting against fossil fuel,"" he said.

The Times of India,India Contributed 12% Of Global Growth In Solar Power In '23 First Half | - Times of India,Manka Behl,"Nagpur: In another sunshine news for India, the country contributed 12% of the global rise in solar generation in the first half of this year.

In a second analysis by energy thinktank Ember released this month, it has come to the fore that India generated 7.1% of its domestic electricity from solar during the period. Analysts looked at data from January to June 2023, compared to the same period last year, across 78 countries representing 92% of global electricity demand.

They found that at a global level, solar generated 5.5% of global electricity in the first half of the year which marked an increase of 16% from the same period last year. ""50 countries set new monthly records for solar generation during this period, including India in May,"" it stated.

The increase in renewable energy in India, amid moderate demand growth, also led to slow growth in coal generation. According to the analysis, the country's power sector emissions grew by 3.7%, which is more than 19 million tonnes of carbon-dioxide in the first half. This was less than half of the growth seen in the first half of 2022 -- over 9.7% -- with close to 45 million tonnes of CO2.

Ember's analysis stated that the growth in wind and solar energy prevented an increase of 11 million tonnes of emissions in India.

Stating that the country has the potential to be a major global player in solar power, Ember's India analyst Neshwin Rodrigues said, ""Renewables are doing the job of slowing India's emissions growth, which is helping to get the world to a plateau in power sector emissions.""

The Times of India,"Reliance unveils swappable, multipurpose batteries for EVs - Times of India","Reuters, Oct 4","GREATER NOIDA: Indian oil refining giant Reliance Industries showcased its swappable and multipurpose battery storage technology for electric vehicles (EVs) on Wednesday, as it makes a big push on clean energy.

Reliance, led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, displayed removable and swappable batteries for EVs that can also be used to power household appliances through an inverter at a renewable energy exhibition.

The idea is that a person can use one battery for mobility as well as for powering appliances at home, company executives at the event said, requesting not to be quoted as they are not authorized to speak with media.

The batteries can be swapped at Reliance's battery swap stations or re-charged by households using rooftop solar panels, which also it plans to sell, the executives added. The executives did not clarify when the company planned to start selling these batteries.

Development of battery storage solutions is a part of Reliance's bigger $10 billion green push towards clean energy projects. The company aims to cut dependence on its mainstay oil-to-chemical business and be net zero carbon by 2035.

The company acquired two battery companies for about $200 million in 2021 and 2022, respectively -- UK-based Faradion that makes sodium-ion batteries, and Lithium Werks, that produces lithium iron phosphate (LFP)batteries. Reliance displayed LFP chemistry based battery at the exhibition.

A company presentation at the event showed it is also working on customizable batteries for business and individual usage, intelligent swap stations and integrated charging networks. Reliance doesn't plan to get in to EV manufacturing but will partner with EV makers, the presentation showed.

Reliance won an incentive last year to set up a 5 gigawatt hours (GWh) battery manufacturing facility under India's $2.4 billion programme that aims to boost local battery cell production.

The factory will be set up by 2026 and will make batteries and containerised energy storage solutions.

Clean auto technology is central to India's strategy of cutting pollution in major cities and reaching its broader climate goals. Electric vehicles currently make up a fraction of total sales in India mainly due to their high price as the batteries are imported, and a lack of charging infrastructure.

The government is trying to encourage swappable batteries to bring down costs and promote wider adoption of EVs.",2023-10-04T09:41:31Z
The Times of India,Nanoparticles Pose Mega Risk To Delhi | Nagpur News - Times of India,Manka Behl,"Nagpur: As winter and along with it the season of deteriorating air quality approaches, air quality monitoring data has revealed rise in levels of nanoparticles in Delhi's air.

According to climate researchers, nanoparticles are minuscule particles measuring between 10 to 1000 nanometres (nm) in diameter, making them invisible to the naked eye. Believed to be more dangerous to human health, these toxic particles are 600 times smaller than a human hair strand and can penetrate deep into the lungs, bloodstream, and the brain.

The study was conducted on Bawana road in the northwest part of the national capital, which connects Delhi to Rohtak in Haryana.

The research was carried out by Rajeev Kumar Mishra, assistant professor at department of environmental engineering, Delhi Technological University; S Ramachandran from the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad; and Kanagaraj Rajagopal, a research scholar from Advanced Air and Acoustics Research Laboratory, Delhi Technological University.

Bawana road, which has a vehicular density of around 1,300 per hour, and an average of 40,000 vehicles per day, was divided into two periods during the research. The first period was from April 1, 2021 to June 30, 2021, while the second was from October 3, 2021 to November 30, 2021. Researchers found that nanoparticles directly related to vehicular exhausts were found more in the roadside areas. ""When the wind speed is high, they get dispersed to the surrounding regions of the road, which may increase the exposure to the residents living nearby,"" they stated.

Highlighting that the ultra-fine particles can contribute up to 90% to the total nanoparticle concentrations in urban areas, Mishra said, ""People working near the road, such as police, street vendors, drivers, motorcyclists, delivery personnel, and the urban poor living around it are more susceptible.""

During the first period, which also saw Covid lockdown, the recorded vehicle fleet was 49% lower than the normal period. Due to this, the nanoparticle concentration was lower by 31% (from the baseline). In the second phase which was post Diwali, the concentration of particles went up by 35%.

""The outcomes of this study can be used to initiate mitigation measures for pollution events with implications to climate change, and help move towards a sustainable future,"" added Mishra.

The CSIR is all set to fully geared up to meet out the requirements of the country specially in terms of meeting all sustainable development goals - from SDG 1 to 17. This is our roadmap for the coming decade,"" said the CSIR director general N Kalaiselvi.

Addressing a gathering of scientists on the occasion of the CSIR's 82nd foundation day, she narrated why the institution felt the need to have yet another vision document despite it already having the one to take forward various developmental works through science, technology and innovation.

She said, ""The Prime Minister has already made all of us understand one basic fact. Unless otherwise we enlarge the canvass we cannot think about or imagine for a big picture of any kind of painting.

""So even though we have CSIR vision 2030 which is already in place, we are now getting fully geared up to enlarge our vision canvass and we'll be coming up with a big plan in the name of CSIR vision 2042 -- the year CSIR would complete 100 years of its establishment"".

Noting that the period till 2047 is an opportunity to fulfill the vision of building a ""strong, inclusive and self-reliant India"", Prime Minister Modi in his message said, ""It is in this context that the role of institutions such as CSIR assumes greater relevance"". His message was read out by the science & technology minister Jitendra Singh.

On the occasion, 12 young scientists received prestigious Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar (SSB) awards. From next year, 56 national science awards, including SSB (called Vigyan Yuva-SSB), will be given to scientists on the occasion of the national space day on August 23.

Referring to some of the achievements and initiatives of the institution, Singh said the Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) Mission is a pioneering initiative undertaken by the CSIR to address the pressing global challenge of reducing carbon emissions and mitigating climate change. He said the Mission focuses on developing innovative technologies and solutions related to CO2 capture, utilisation, and storage.

""I am given to understand that the key stakeholders with whom CSIR has been discussing this Mission include Adani, Reliance, Tata Steel, Ultratech Cement, NTPC, JSW Steel, among others,"" said the minister.

Moved by the sight of the poor begging for food on the streets, this class 8 student chose to put her coding skills to use for some social good after she learnt the fundamentals of block programming under a special short-term course conducted at the Eklavya Model Residential School in Kodavaluru.

Niharika is one of the 20 students from the EMRS' in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha who displayed their projects at the 'EMRS Coders Expo' in Delhi as the ministry of tribal affairs launched the second phase of the 'Amazon Future Engineer Programme' in 54 EMRS schools where they will be taught advanced block programming and AI curriculum.

14-year-old Gamit Khushi Ajitbhai who is a class 7 student of EMRS Indu-vvyaar in Gujarat brought out the criticality of ocean pollution through an engaging game where she lands a robot on the ocean bed and then uses buttons to move the robot swiftly to eat up all the waste falling into the water.

The game ends when the result shows that the ocean is ""clean."" The visuals of plastic floating on the sea and the shore she saw on television inspired her to create the game.

In Phase-1 of the programme, launched last year in collaboration with Amazon India and Learning Links Foundation (LLF) students of classes 6 to 8 in 54 schools were introduced to fundamentals of computer science and block programming modules.

According to officials from National Education Society for Tribal Students (NESTS) students applied block programming concepts on code.org platform and developed computational projects on themes like hunger, climate change, road safety and ocean pollution bringing focus on the sustainable development goals. The top 20 coding projects were presented at the Coders expo in Delhi.

According to officials, so far 7,000 children, many of them first in their families to go to a school have completed the 20 hours course introducing them to the fundamentals of computer science and coding.

The Times of India,Delhi gets its first buses running on green hydrogen - Times of India,Sanjay Dutta,"NEW DELHI: The national capital Delhi on Monday got its first glimpse into zero-emission future of the city's public transport, with oil minister Hardeep Singh Puri flagging off the trial run of two hydrogen buses procured by the country's largest oil refiner and fuel retailer IndianOil Corporation from Tata Motors.

The fleet size will increase to 15 by the end of the year, Puri said at the time of flagging off the buses that will initially ply on national capital region without passengers. In addition to Delhi, routes across Haryana and UP have been identified for running hydrogen buses once the fleet size expands.

IndianOil will supply fuel for the two buses from a small green hydrogen facility built for the trials at its R&D facility in Faridabad. The facility will produce 75 kg of green hydrogen by electrolysing water with electricity from renewable sources.

The buses are powered by fuel cells based on polymer electrolyte membrane. They have four tanks with a total capacity of 30 kgs and can be refilled in 10-12 minutes, which is similar to petrol or diesel vehicles. Senior IndianOil executives claimed a range of 350 kms with four full tanks of hydrogen.

Hydrogen -- especially green hydrogen -- has been identified as ""fuel of the future"", and is being seen as a major cog in the global decarbonisation wheel. This is because hydrogen emits water vapour when used in fuel cells. IndianOil has also conducted a pilot project of running buses on H-CNG, or CNG laced with hydrogen extracted from natural gas, to further improve combustion and emission.

""Our government has ambitious plans on clean and green energy. India has taken many steps towards low carbon development- through emerging fuels like hydrogen and biofuels and shall account for 25% of global incremental energy demand growth over the next two decades,"" Puri said.

About 50 units of renewable power and 9 kg of deionised water are needed for the production of a Kg of green hydrogen.",2023-09-25T16:32:48Z

The Times of India,India suspends visa for Canadians: Can Indians travel to Canada? Who will be impacted and who are exempted - Times of India,"TIMESOFINDIA COM, Sep","NEW DELHI: Characterizing Canada as a sanctuary for terrorists, a label previously applied only to Pakistan, the Indian government took a significant step on Thursday by suspending visa processing services in the North American nation. This move came in response to threats from Khalistan forces, which hindered the ability of Indian diplomats to carry out their duties.

Against the backdrop of a heated diplomatic dispute triggered by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's allegations that India might have been linked to the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a pro-Khalistan activist and Canadian national, India also made the decision to suspend the e-visa facility for Canadian citizens.

Here is an FAQs on India's visa suspension for Canadians:

Why did India suspend visa services for Canadians?

A: India suspended visa services for Canadians on September 21, 2023, citing security threats to its diplomatic missions in Canada. The move came after Canada accused India of allegedly being involved in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was shot dead in Surrey, B.C., on June 18, 2023. India has denied the allegation and expelled a Canadian diplomat in retaliation.

Q: Who is affected by the suspension of visa services?

A: All Canadian nationals who intend to visit India and do not have a valid visa are affected by the suspension of visa services. This includes tourists, students, business travellers, and others. The suspension also applies to Canadians in a third country who want to apply for an Indian visa.

Q: What are the exemptions from the suspension of visa services?

A: The suspension of visa services does not affect those who already have a valid Indian visa or an Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card. OCI card holders are people of Indian origin who have acquired foreign citizenship. They can enter and stay in India indefinitely without a visa.

Q: How long will the suspension of visa services last?

A: There is no official announcement on how long the suspension of visa services will last. It depends on how the diplomatic row between India and Canada is resolved. Both countries have expressed their desire to maintain good relations and cooperate on various issues, such as trade, security, and climate change.

Q: What are the alternatives for Canadians who want to visit India?

A: Canadians who want to visit India and do not have a valid visa or an OCI card have limited options. They can try to apply for an emergency visa at the Indian High Commission in Ottawa or the Consulates General in Toronto and Vancouver. However, these visas are only granted for urgent and compelling reasons, such as death or serious illness of a family member in India. Another option is to wait until the suspension of visa services is lifted or travel to another country that does not require a visa for Canadians.

Q: Can Indians with valid visas travel to Canada?

A: Yes, Indians with valid visas can travel to Canada. There are no restrictions on Indian travelers to Canada or on those with valid Indian visas. However, India has issued a travel advisory asking Indian nationals, including students and citizens planning on traveling to Canada, to exercise caution. They have been advised to avoid travelling to regions and potential venues in Canada that have seen growing anti-India activities, such as protests by Sikh separatists.

Q: Has Canada suspended processing of visas for Indians?

A: No, Canada has not suspended processing of visas for Indians.",2023-09-22T06:37:48Z
The Times of India,"Hc To Consider Ngo, Citizens' Grievances On Koradi Plant Expansion Public Hearing | Nagpur News - Times of India",Vaibhav Ganjapure,"Nagpur: The Nagpur bench of Bombay high court on Wednesday agreed to consider the grievances raised by a NGO and citizens, opposing the environmental public hearing conducted on May 29 for proposed expansion of Koradi power plant.

A division bench comprising justices Atul Chandurkar and Vrushali Joshi issued notices to the respondents, including central and state governments, asking them to respond within four weeks. ""We find that for the present this court can consider the grievances raised by the petitioners to the conduct of environmental public hearing as well as the steps sought to be taken against the alleged erring officers of the Maharashtra State Power Generation Company (Mahagenco) under Section 15 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986,"" the bench said.

The PIL was filed by Vidarbha Connect (VCan) secretary Dinesh Naidu, former MSEDCL director (operations) Anil Palamwar, and Sharad Pawar, retired scientist of Nuclear Agriculture and Biotechnology Division at Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) in Mumbai, challenging the environmental hearing conducted by Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) and Mahagenco.

The petitioners through counsel Tushar Mandlekar assisted by Tejas Fadnavis sought fresh public hearing and directives to MPCB to initiate action against Mahagenco officials for failure to control pollution from Koradi Power Plant. They contended that the proposed expansion of Koradi thermal power plant by adding two new units of 660 MW each was in contrast to the September 14, 2006, notification of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MOEFCC).

Earlier, Mohit Khajanchi appearing for Mahagenco argued that the petitioners should raise the grievances before the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in view of the provisions of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010, as well as the decisions taken by the Supreme Court in cases of Indian Oil Corporation Limited versus VBR Menon and Vanashakti versus Union of India.

Besides MOEFCC, Union power ministry, MPCB member secretary, Mahagenco chairman and managing director, Nagpur collector, zilla parishad chief executive officer (CEO), District Industries Centre general manager, Nagpur Metropolitan Region Development Authority chairman, and Nagpur Municipal Corporation commissioner, have been made respondents in the PIL.

Pointing out that MPCB and collector had conducted an environmental public hearing on May 29 at a pandal erected on open space at Koradi plant during peak summer, the petitioners prayed for directives to conduct the hearing again.

The Times of India,Bio-cng Plant To Help Clear Garbage Piles At Dump Site | Ludhiana News - Times of India,Sep,"Ludhiana: People living around the MC garbage dump site in Jamalpur face conditions alien to the rest of Ludhiana, one of the richest cities in the country. A garbage mountain separates two worlds - a glitsy metropolis and an urban dystopia. A stench always hangs in the air here, making breathing difficult. Watering eyes are common and often, when the huge garbage mountain nearby catches fire, an all pervading burning smell warns residents. Reeking garbage mounds at the MC's garbage dumping site in Jamalpur attest to the fact that solid waste has not been processed for a long time. The facility stopped over two years ago. Since then, fresh waste has been allowed to pile up, creating garbage mountains.

Things could change now as Engineers India Limited (EIL), a company offering sustainable development solutions, has expressed willingness to set up a bio CNG plant in the city, that too free of cost.

The company is also willing to maintain the plant for 20 years. For the MC, this is an opportunity to resolve a persistent problem at little expense in terms of money and time. Even the complex tendering process can be done away with, provided the civic body gives land and arranges transport segregated wet waste to the site.

The Union ministry of housing and urban affairs has tied up with EIL for such projects. Recently, a meeting was held between the EIL team, MC officials and other senior officials at the Punjab Municipal Infrastructure Development Company (PMIDC) office in Chandigarh, where the project was discussed.

One proposal is for Ludhiana and another is for Jalandhar. A compressed biogas plant of 200 tons per day capacity is to be constructed in Ludhiana. PMIDC has written a letter to MC officials to stop their ongoing tendering process to hire an agency for the project.

MC commissioner Sandeep Rishi confirmed the move and said, ""We have given consent to EIL for this work. MC will provide the land at token lease rent without any revenue sharing."" He added that EIL would be given 18 months to complete the plant and three months to get it started. He also said that the Government of India would now direct them to start preparatory work like getting permissions from ministry of environment, forest and climate change.

The Times of India,August Saw Lowest Rainfall In 48 Yrs Along Coastal Districts: Expert | Mangaluru News - Times of India,Deepthi Sanjiv,"Mangaluru: Deficit rainfall has been a significant concern in the coastal districts this year. Pataje Govindayya Sathyanarayana Prasad, popularly known as PGSN Prasad, an agriculturist from Balila near Bellare, about 80km from here, who has been recording rainfall manually for the last 48 years, said this is the lowest amount of rainfall received in August.

He told TOI, ""This is the lowest since I started documenting rains. In 1977, 551mm rainfall was recorded; this year, just 331mm has been recorded for the month in the region as against 965mm, the average rainfall for August. Overall, the rainfall deficit is 23% for August. Since September 3, it has started raining again, especially in Sullia Taluk. If the same trend continues, the region may receive 600-700mm rainfall,"" he said.

The rainfall pattern in August has been quite unusual. ""We are optimistic that the shortfall in rainfall will be compensated for in the upcoming days. In July, we received 20% more rain than the average. However, by the end of August, our region has experienced only 88 days of rain, which falls short of the typical 109 days of rainfall we usually receive. If we look back to 1965, the region experienced an exceptionally low 123 days of rain. Nevertheless, since I began documenting rainfall, the lowest recorded was 144 days of rain in 1986 and 2007. On the flip side, we observed a record high of 202 days of rainfall in 2021. On an average, our region typically receives around 165 days of rainfall annually. We hope the region will continue to receive rain until the end of November, even though it may not be consistent throughout this period."" he said.

Meanwhile, experts are predicting one of the worst summers next year if the rainfall fails to pick up. ""Adding to our worries is the significant depletion of the groundwater table due to a rise in the number of borewells. Previously, water could be found at depths of 200-300 feet, but now, it has dropped to the alarming depths of 700-800 feet. Moreover, the expected groundwater recharge is not occurring as anticipated,"" Prasad said.

In a proactive effort to engage and educate the younger generation about the importance of monitoring rainfall, Prasad, the correspondent of Vidya Bodhini Higher Primary and High School, has taken the initiative to teach children how to measure rain.

Students at both schools have started recording rainfall data. In Balila village, rainfall is being measured at six different locations and about 70 individuals are actively involved in rain measurement efforts across the district. This community engagement is a positive step toward understanding and addressing our region's changing climate patterns, Prasad said.",2023-09-14T03:14:52Z
The Times of India,Villagers in Pilibhit sit on hunger strike over floods | Bareilly News - Times of India,Keshav Agarwal,"PILIBHIT: Unhappy with the apathy of the officials to protect the village of 6,000 from flood waters of the river Sharda, residents of Chandia Hajara sat on an indefinite hunger strike on Monday. Village pradhan Vasudev Kundu said that more than 200 acres of cultivated land have been eroded during the monsoon season.

Since July, the village has been battered by five devastating floods. Despite repeated appeals to the district administration for flood control measures, the villagers claim that no preventive actions have been taken thus far.

The situation worsened when water was released from the Banvasa barrage into the Sharda River. The entire village of Chandia Hajara found itself submerged in knee-deep floodwaters as 1.41 lakh cusecs of water were released at 10 pm on Sunday and 1.31 lakh cusecs were released on Monday morning.

The Times of India,Older women 'central actors' in achieving SDG goals: UN report - Times of India,Ambika Pandit,"NEW DELHI: As the world stands halfway to the end point of the 2030 sustainable development goals, a new UN report brings special focus on older women, their well-being and how they are ""central actors"" in achieving sustainable development. While calling for focussed measures for older women, the report highlights how the challenges and concerns of older women are often overlooked in discussions about women, gender, and, to some degree, older persons.

In 2023, women made up 55.7% of people aged 65 and above globally.

The 'Progress on the Sustainable Development Goals: The Gender Snapshot 2023' report brought out by UN Women and UNDESA finds that older women face higher rates of poverty and violence than older men. In 28 of the 116 countries with data, fewer than half of older women have a pension; in 12 countries fewer than 10% had access to a pension.

It is also highlighted that older women are more likely than older men to be widowed, less likely to remarry and more likely to live alone -- three features that can worsen economic insecurity in old age. Globally, in 2023, women aged 55 to 59 are more likely to live in extreme poverty than men (8% compared to 6.9%).

Today, there are nearly 808 million older people in the world accounting for 10% of the global population. Since women outlive men by an average of 5.2 years, they comprise a greater share of older persons. It is estimated that by 2050, there will be 1.6 billion persons aged 65 and older, 78.1% of whom will reside in less developed regions.

""Women tend to live more of their lives in ill health or with a disability, particularly later in life. Chronic conditions, such as arthritis, osteoporosis and depression, for example, impact quality of life and are experienced at higher rates among older women, as compared to older men,"" the report highlights.

The report paints a worrisome picture as it states that ""despite global efforts, the world is falling short of achieving gender equality"". It warns that, if current trends continue, more than 340 million women and girls -- an estimated 8% of the world's female population -- will live in extreme poverty by 2030, and close to one in four will experience moderate or severe food insecurity.

Factfile

""The gender gap in power and leadership positions remains entrenched, and, at the current rate of progress, the next generation of women will still spend on average 2.3 more hours per day on unpaid care and domestic work than men,"" it says.

This year's report includes sex-disaggregated data on the intersections of gender and climate change for the first time, and projects that by mid-century, under a worst-case climate scenario, climate change may push up to 158.3 million more women and girls into poverty (16 million more than the total number of men and boys).

""Globally, an estimated $360 billion per year in additional funding towards gender equality is needed to advance progress on key areas of gender equality,"" states the report as it calls for urgent measures and collective action to achieve the goals. The report cautions that failure to prioritise gender equality now could jeopardise the entire 2030 agenda for sustainable development.",2023-09-11T18:11:12Z
The Times of India,African Union becomes permanent member of G20: All you need to know about it - Times of India,"TIMESOFINDIA COM, Sep 9","NEW DELHI: It's official now. After trying to get a seat at the the G20 table for many years, the African Union formally assumed its position as a new member of the G20 on Saturday, following an invitation from the summit host, Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

""In keeping with the sentiment of sabka saath (taking along everyone), India had proposed that the African Union should be given permanent membership of the G20. I believe we all are in agreement on this proposal. With your agreement (he banged the gavel thrice)...,"" PM Modi said while inviting AU chairperson Azali Assoumani to take the seat as a full member of the G20.

In recent years, India has strategically positioned itself as a prominent advocate for addressing concerns, challenges, and aspirations of the Global South, particularly the African continent.

Prime Minister Modi has been at the forefront of advocating for the African Union's (AU) inclusion as a member of the G20. In June, Modi penned a letter to G20 leaders, strongly advocating for granting full membership to the AU within the grouping, a proposal that was subsequently incorporated into the draft communique for the summit during the third G20 Sherpas meeting held in Karnataka's Hampi in July.

Here is all you need to know about Africa Union:

The AU is an influential organisation comprising 55 member states that make up the countries of the African continent.

At full strength the African Union has 55 members, but six junta-ruled nations are currently suspended. Collectively it has a GDP of $3 trillion with some 1.4 billion people.

With G20 membership, the AU can represent a continent that hosts the world's largest free trade area and possesses abundant resources crucial for combating climate change. Africa's contribution to global emissions is relatively low, yet it bears the brunt of climate impacts.

Africa holds 60% of the world's renewable energy resources and over 30% of the minerals essential for renewable and low-carbon technologies. For example, Congo alone possesses nearly half of the world's cobalt, a critical component in lithium-ion batteries, according to a recent United Nations report on Africa's economic development. African leaders are eager to move beyond resource extraction and processing and foster more industrial development within the continent to boost their own economies.

The African Union has been advocating for substantial roles within global organizations that have traditionally represented a now-dated post-World War II order. This includes the United Nations Security Council, where they seek meaningful participation. Additionally, they are calling for reforms in the global financial system, including institutions like the World Bank, which has historically imposed higher borrowing costs on African countries, exacerbating their debt burden.

Pointing out that the state directorate of agriculture has extended the last date for submission for suggestions to the draft agriculture policy to September 15, GFPK said that it was imperative that the issue is discussed at the gram sabhas, as it concerns ""the interests of all villages in Goa which will be directly impacted by the policy."" tnn

""This will enable wide ranging participation and awareness on the issue which affects each and every household in Goa, whether it's a farmer's house or not, because surely there has to be food on everyone's plate,"" Jack Mascarenhas of GFPK said.

GFPK has maintained that the agriculture policy for Goa should be land-, farmer- and crop-centric, and that it should ""clearly establish its vision for the primary components facing multiple challenges.""

""If the policy is not centered on land, farmer and crop, the policy as a whole will be handicapped. All the three areas are basic and need collective attention or it can impact the planning in individual areas,"" GFPK has stated.

While stressing on the urgent need to formulate a land use policy, GFPK said that with the climate change crisis, coastal states like Goa need a ""holistic vision"" on its land, water, soil, environmental issues, etc.

""However, with a lot of changes attempted in the Regional Plans and ODP's of various Planning areas, it is noted that land in Goa is turning fast into a commercial commodity and in such a scenario agricultural land faces a lot of real estate and related commercial challenges,"" GFPK said.",2023-08-23T19:34:40Z
The Times of India,"GAIL to invest Rs 30,000 crore in next 3 years; scouts for LNG abroad - Times of India","PTI, Updated Aug","NEW DELHI: India's top gas firm GAIL (India) Ltd plans to invest Rs 30,000 crore in the next three years as it expands petrochemical capacity and scouts for LNG supplies globally, its chairman Sandeep Kumar Gupta said on Wednesday.

The nation's top gas marketing and transportation firm is looking at liquefied natural gas (LNG) as a transport fuel, joining Essar-promoted GreenLine which operates the nation's largest LNG-powered fleet of heavy commercial vehicles.

Speaking at the company's annual shareholders meeting, Gupta said the firm had a Rs 10,000 crore capex in the 2022-23 fiscal (April 2022 to March 2023).

""The company is growing steadily and creating infrastructure facilities across the nation. We are targeting to incur a capex Rs 30,000 Crore in the next three years, mainly on pipelines, ongoing petrochemical Projects, CGD projects, operational capex, equity contribution in group companies etc,"" he said.

With 15,600 kilometres of pipelines under operation and about 4,200 km of pipelines under construction, GAIUL will complete around 20,000 km of the national gas grid in the next calendar year, he said.

GAIL has also won the licence to lay, build and operate the 160 km Gurdaspur-Jammu natural gas pipeline.

With this, GAIL shall be enabling access to natural gas to the northern as well as north-eastern parts of the country also, through the Barauni-Guwahati pipeline (BGPL) (729 km) section as an integral part of Jagdishpur-Haldia & Bokaro-Dhamra Pipeline (JHBDPL).

Gupta said with India's increasing petrochemical demand, India is projected to contribute more than 10 per cent of the incremental global growth in petrochemicals over the next decade.

GAIL recently acquired private-sector chemical company JBF Petrochemicals Ltd, adding 1.25 million tonnes of petchem capacity.

""This acquisition offers GAIL an opportunity to add a new chemical product, purified terephthalic acid (PTA) to GAIL's existing product portfolio. Your company is also implementing 500,000 tonnes per annum of the country's first propane dehydrogenation PP plant at Usar and another 60,000 tonnes of polypropylene at Pata,"" he said.

Also, GAIL is also setting up its first specialty chemical plant of 50,000 tonnes isopropyl alcohol (IPA) at Usar in Maharashtra.

""With these additions, your company's portfolio of petrochemicals/ chemicals would become 3 million tonnes per annum,"" he said.

GAIL is also ""exploring opportunities of ethane sourcing for its existing petrochemical plant while prospects of setting up of ethane cracker is also being studied,"" he said.

GAIL, he said, is exploring long-term LNG sourcing opportunities with major global LNG players.

""Your Company has issued an expression of interest (EoI) to explore the opportunity of equity acquisition in an LNG liquefaction terminal along with 1 million tonnes LNG tie up from USA.

""Your company has taken steps to provide tie-in connections with its natural gas pipelines to the upcoming new gas sources and upcoming LNG terminals to enable more and new gas injections into its pipelines,"" he said.

GAIL's Strategy 2030 also entails exploring various opportunities for increasing its renewable portfolio through organic as well as inorganic routes.

""Towards shaping a net zero future, your company is exploring various business avenues such as solar, biofuels, compressed bio-gas, carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS), green hydrogen, etc,"" he said.

GAIL is setting up a 10 MW green hydrogen production unit based on PEM water electrolyzers (the largest in India) with a capacity of 4.3 tonnes per day at Vijaipur Madhya Pradesh, which is expected to be commissioned by December 2023.

The firm is carrying out studies to see the impact of various levels of hydrogen blending in natural gas.

""In a first-of-its-kind initiative in India, your company is setting up small-scale LNG plants to cater to diversified areas viz., geographic areas (GAs) not having connectivity to the pipeline, business of LNG as a transport fuel and monetizing gas from stranded fields,"" he said.

GAIL has procured two liquefaction skids of 16-18 tonnes a day capacity. ""The skids are portable (Plug-&-play type) and scalable liquefaction units and are likely to be commissioned shortly,"" he said.

It is also exploring the possibility of small-scale manufacturing facilities in India.

""Additionally, GAIL is developing an LNG supply value chain to develop new markets and increase the consumption of natural gas in the country. The present focus is on developing a retail LNG network and installation of LNG infrastructure inclusive of LNG dispensing stations, small-scale LNG skids, etc. to increase its reach to newer customer segments,"" he said.

GreenLine, backed by Exponentia Ventures - the venture capital arm of the Essar Group, is pioneering green mobility in long-haul, heavy-duty freight transportation in India.

As the first and only logistics provider operating an LNG-powered fleet of 55-tonnes heavy commercial vehicles in the country today, GreenLine is partnering in the carbon neutrality missions of conscious corporates by enabling them to decarbonize their heavy trucking through a switch from diesel to a cleaner alternative - LNG (liquefied natural gas).

GreenLine's LNG-powered fleet significantly reduces toxic emissions compared to diesel - carbon dioxide by up to 30 per cent, sulphur oxides by up to 100 per cent, nitrogen oxides by up to 59 per cent, carbon monoxide by up to 70 per cent, and particulate matter by up to 91 per cent.

It has signed up to decarbonize their heavy trucking logistics of Tata Steel, Reliance Industries, JSW Cement, UltraTech Cement, Nestle, Delhivery, JK Lakshmi Cement, Dalmia Cement and JSPL.",2023-08-23T10:07:39Z
The Hindu,"India is 'indispensable' pharma partner, but must meet U.S. drug standards: U.S. Health Secretary",,"Indian companies need to meet U.S. drug standards if they want to continue exporting their drugs to America, the U.S. Secretary for Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra said on August 18, underlining the potential for growth in the partnership.

Speaking on the sidelines of the ongoing G-20 Health Ministers' meeting in Gujarat's capital, Mr. Becerra also cautioned against the unregulated proliferation of artificial intelligence across the health sector, while maintaining that it is important to harness the innovation that technology has to offer.

""Meeting the drug standards would not only help India continue its trade with the U.S. specifically, but also maintain the standards and its growth graph across the world,'' he said, adding that India is an indispensable partner in helping the U.S. meet its pharmaceuticals needs.

Standardisation of drugs needed

India has recently come under fire from some countries for alleged contamination in drugs that it exports. Stating that India remains one of the most important partners in maintaining the drug supply across the world, Mr. Becerra said that the U.S. sought deeper co-operation and the standardisation of drugs that would make it possible for Indian-manufactured drugs to accepted by everyone across the world.

""India is at a crucial and much stronger juncture today than what it was a few decades ago and we are looking at seeing it expand its capacity,'' he said.

He added that U.S. participation in the G-20 meet was a clear sign of the deepening relationship with India and maintained that it would pay dividends for both countries. ""It will in fact pay dividends for the world because I believe people see India and the U.S. to be global leaders,'' he said, adding that the U.S. has a very strong and interdependent relationship with India when it comes to pharmaceuticals.

""We depend on India, India depends on us and together we can both thrive when it comes to making sure medicines are available not just to our people but to the world,"" he noted.

Collaboration on drug supplies

Mr. Becerra said that during his session with Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, one of the issues discussed was ""how we make sure that we're coordinating, collaborating when it comes to the safety and availability of pharmaceutical medicines"".

The U.S. Secretary also acknowledged the recent shortage of some select drugs for cancer and influenza in the U.S. and said that top U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials would be in India shortly to ensure that there is no break in the supply chain of medicines that would put Americans under stress.

Pandemic lessons

Speaking about the U.S. commitment to G-20 outcomes and the lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic, he said: ""COVID has taught us that nobody is safe until everyone is safe. G-20 is a step in the right direction where we have gathered as a community to commit to a protocol on how we deal with preparation and response to future health threats, pandemic or otherwise.''

""During the pandemic, both India and the U.S. showed that [they have] the capacity to counter the health crisis as both came up with vaccines for [their] citizens. I think COVID taught us to work together and that taught us the importance of a G-20-like meet. We are also getting ready for the upcoming world health assembly scheduled for next year,"" he said.

He added that climate change and its relationship to health outcomes is also an area of vital importance and maintained that these chapters are interrelated and affect everyone. ""We are very appreciative that India has made this one of the priorities,'' he noted.",2023-08-18T15:18:04Z

The Times of India,"Agra: PepsiCo India expands its flagship program on plastic waste management, 'Tidy Trails' to Agra - Times of India","TIMESOFINDIA COM, Aug 2","PepsiCo India in partnership with The Social Lab (TSL) has announced the expansion of Tidy Trails, an initiative focused on education and awareness around plastic circularity in Agra, Uttar Pradesh. With support of the Agra Nagar Nigam, the initiative aims to share best practices with shopping establishments to support plastic waste management and recycling in the city.

As part of the initiative, a dedicated mobile van has been deployed to visit local shops across Agra, collecting post-consumer plastic waste from over 500 shopping establishments across five market associations. In the first month of the pilot, over 50kgs of plastic waste collected on average daily and sent for recycling. Over 500 specially branded dustbins were also distributed to the shopping establishments to mark the launch.

In line with the company's pep+ (PepsiCo Positive) commitment, PepsiCo India has launched various initiatives around plastic waste management in Uttar Pradesh to help build a world where plastic never becomes waste. Under the Tidy Trails initiative, all plastic waste collected from shops will go to waste collectors for segregation, and later will be recycled and converted into useful items like benches and chairs, to be distributed across parks and offices of Agra. To commemorate the launch, PepsiCo India will also distribute 60 benches made of plastic, recycled with 21 century Polymers, for installation in Agra.

Addressing virtually, Ashwini Kumar Choubey, minister of state, ministry of environment, forest and climate change, said, ""The challenge of plastic pollution demands a collective effort, where public and private sectors work together for common good.

As part of the program, 25,000 kgs of plastic was collected from 800 establishments across the city and involved 70 municipal wards. Through various awareness drives, events, nukkad-nataks and competitions, the initiative successfully reached 6.2 lakh people with focus on driving behavioral change towards responsible plastic waste management.",2023-08-02T12:22:00Z
The Times of India,Going Back To The Roots: How The Aravalis In Badkhal Were Restored | Gurgaon News - Times of India,Ipsita Pati,"GURGAON: It was in the 90s that vilayati kikar -- small trees with thorns that thrive in semi-arid conditions -- were introduced to the Aravalis. What the plantation drive, one funded by the European Union, didn't anticipate was the capacity of the trees to wipe out the region's native vegetation.

Chiseled rocks -- remnants of a mining pit -- lay on the undulating hills of the Aravalis in Badkhal that was among the areas infiltrated by vilayati kikar until a few years back.

Around 220 hectares of this area in Badkhal is now transformed, enveloped in an explosion of greenery in the years that the forest department pulled out vilayati kikar to plant native species. Lush canopies made way for more shade, and shrubs dotted the land. Abrus precatorius, with its cherry red seeds, twined round the tree trunks, creeping up on all the wood it could find.

Locals pointed to the native trees in Badkhal -- raunjh (acacia leucophloea), desi babool (acacia nilotica), kumuth (acacia senegal), siris (albizia lebbeck), dhau (anogeissus pendula), hingoth (balanites roxburghii), salai (boswellia serrata), palaash (butea monosperma), jungle karondha (carissa spinarum) and amaltas (cassia fistula).

The locals also spoke of the shrubs native to this area -- chitrak (plumbago zeylanica), dhauliya (securinega leucopyrus), jhadber (ziziphus nummularia) and makoy (ziziphus oenopolia).

This natural regeneration project by the forest department in Faridabad began in 2020. The forest officials told TOI it is now in its last phase and will be concluded this year.

In the first year of its implementation, the department uprooted vilayati kikar over 110 hectares of land, and started planting indigenous species in the Badkhal catchment area. This area was increased by another 110 acres in the years that followed. Two water bodies, each lying over an acre of area, were developed too.

""An extensive restoration action in the Badkhal catchment area in the Aravali hills for forest restoration has helped in improving the habitat for flora and wildlife. It is in the final stages. The area which has been restored is around 220 hectares. We carried out plantation drives, but we also found natural regeneration of rootstock,"" said Rajkumar, divisional forest officer, Faridabad.

The area is also protected under sections 4 and 5 of the Punjab Land Preservation Act (PLPA) and is part of the Aravali plantation area, where construction is banned banned.

Experts told TOI the area was also critical for wildlife.

A 2017 survey by the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) had listed 11 species of mammals, including those critically endangered world over. The region is home to nilgai, Indian porcupine, small indian civet, Indian fox, black-naped hare, striped hyena, Indian golden jackal, leopard, honey badger, small indian mongoose and ruddy mongoose.

""The area plays an important passage for leopard dispersal from Damdama valley to Asola Bhatti wildlife sanctuary via Mangar Bani. It also is the future of water security and can turn into an important nature-based solution for climate change adaptation in the densely populated urban belt stretching from Gurgaon to Faridabad in Haryana,"" said Sunil Harsana, who is an ecologist and wildlife expert.

Experts also said a rich ecosystem, which also helps wildlife flourish within an area, cannot comprise just one species of vegetation.

""The Aravalis has a robust ecology if not mined. Vilayati kikar is an exotic species that has wiped out some native plants. While it survived very well in the rocky terrain, with little care and even less water, it also impeded the growth of indigenous trees,"" said Vijay Dhasmana, ecologist and curator of the Aravalli Biodiversity Park in Gurgaon.",2023-07-27T03:44:00Z

The Times of India,NGT sets up eight-member panel to check pollution around AIIMS | Delhi News - Times of India,"TNN, Updated Jul 5","NEW DELHI: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has directed an eight-member joint committee to implement the recommendations submitted by School of Planning and Architecture (SPA) to check sources of pollution around AIIMS Delhi, which has impacted patients and staff.

The tribunal has also asked the panel to monitor air quality in and around the hospital and, when required, put GRAP measures in place.

NGT, in its order dated July 3, also constituted a five-member joint committee, headed by secretary, health ministry, to check sources of pollution outside all government district hospitals or bigger facilities, including medical colleges.

In June, SPA conducted a survey on the directions of an NGT-appointed committee headed by Central Pollution Control Committee (CPCB) to assess pollution sources within a 500-metre radius of AIIMS. It found traffic congestion, irregular parking, encroachments, poor condition of service roads and vehicle-pedestrian conflicts as the major causes, following which it listed preventive measures, based on which the joint committee submitted a report.

""Since there is no objection to the report of the joint committee, we accept it and issue directions to implement it,"" said the NGT bench headed by chairperson Adarsh Kumar Goel.

The order said a hospital complex requires an environment management plan for its premises as well as surrounding areas. The tribunal stated that prohibited and regulated activities need to be identified and mentioned in such a plan and a dedicated nodal agency is required for monitoring and funds.

""With regard to measures required to be adopted outside the AIIMS campus, such as control of traffic congestion, removing encroachments, congestion at gates, speeding of vehicles, improving road conditions, control of dust and other sources of pollution, we constitute an eight-member joint committee of traffic police, NDMC, PWD, DDA, Delhi Police, AIIMS, CPCB and DPCC to prepare an action plan in the light of the recommendations of the joint committee and monitor its execution in a time-bound manner,"" the order read.

NGT also asked the committee to monitor air quality in and around the campus and implement measures under GRAP within the 500-metre buffer zone when needed.

""The police commissioner and the AIIMS director will act jointly as the nodal agency for coordination and compliance... Execution of the plan may be reviewed periodically, preferably once a month, for the next six months. The first review meeting is to be held by August 31,"" the order stated.

The NGT bench said it was necessary to issue directions in this regard as there are identical issues in several other government hospitals, including Safdarjung Hospital. it added that an appropriate action plan should be prepared by the environment and health ministries after due consideration of the subject.

""We constitute a five-member joint committee to be headed by secretary, ministry of health, with representatives of ministries of environment, forest and climate change; urban development; and home affairs, not below the rank of joint secretary, and a nominee of CPCB not below the rank of director,"" the order read.

The SPA study had found that traffic movement was slow within AIIMS and in the 500-metre buffer, leading to heavy emissions, dust and pollution. The survey analysed traffic movement and other aspects of major road stretches like MG Road, Ring Road, Sri Aurobindo Marg and areas like Yusuf Sarai, Gautam Nagar, Neeti Bagh, Masjid Moth, Gulmohar Park, parts of South Extension, Kidwai Nagar, Ansari Nagar and Green Park.

Born 26 weeks into her 30-year-old mother's second pregnancy, Siya weighed 440 grams at birth.

""Siya is one of the lowest birth weight babies to survive in India,"" said neonatologist Dr K P Sanghavi of St Elizabeth Hospital, Malabar Hill, who took care of the premature baby after her birth on March 13.

She returned to the hospital for her first checkup since her discharge last month, and the change is apparent. ""She now weighs 2.1kg, a far cry from the less than 500gm at birth,"" said her mother.

Globally, the lowest birth weight baby to survive is a 243gm Canadian girl born at 21 weeks and five days of pregnancy. In India, there are various reports of premature babies surviving with a birth weight of less than 500gm.

In Mumbai, neonatologist Dr Nandkishor Kabra from Surya Hospital, Santacruz, said the lowest birth weight baby to survive in his care is a 410gm boy born at 24 weeks.

Two factors are considered while treating premature babies: Their gestational age and birth weight. According to Dr Kabra, ""Gestational age is more important in determining a better outcome to prematurity."" The youngest in terms of gestation age he has treated is a girl born at 22 weeks but she weighed 600gm.

""Any child born around 24 weeks and weighing between 400gm and 500gm has a 60% to 70% chance of survival,"" said Dr Kabra. Data released jointly by the UNICEF and the World Health Organisation last month said over 9 lakh of the 134 lakh prematurely born children in 2020 died soon after birth.

The report also said that gains made in the prevention of stillbirths are being pushed back due to the ""devastating combination of Covid-19, climate change, expanding conflicts and rising living costs"".

Siya's mother who lives in Mira Road had come to the 100-year-old Elizabeth Hospital for a second opinion after her blood pressure started rising. ""I had already suffered one stillbirth, and didn't want a repeat of things,"" she said. The doctors suggested immediate delivered of the child to prevent anything untoward.

Dr Sanghavi said the fact that Siya was fed on mother's milk from day two of birth made a big difference. ""Many doctors believe feeding increases the risk of infection, but my studies have shown otherwise,"" he said. Siya also had limited exposure to antibiotics-only seven days after her birth.

""Unlike many premature babies who soon develop health problems such as retinopathy (disease of the small retinal blood vessels) or necrotising enterocolitis (inflammation of intestine leading to bacterial infection), Siya had no complications till the day she was discharged,"" he said.

Her mother said Siya's 72-day hospital stay mainly focused on her weight gain. ""I would visit every day to ensure she had pumped milk, yet it took her two and half months to become 1.5kg.""",2023-06-27T08:20:00Z
The Times of India,Jaishankar and G20 delegates visit holy Buddhist sites in Sarnath | India News - Times of India,"PTI, Jun","VARANASI (UP): External affairs minister S Jaishankar along with G20 delegates on Tuesday visited the historical Buddhist site of Dhamek Stupa in Sarnath here, officials said.

The delegates from different countries have arrived here for the three-day G20 Development Ministers' conclave, which commenced on Sunday.

Around 12 km from the ancient temple town of Varanasi, Sarnath is one of the most revered Buddhist pilgrimage centres in the world. The Dhamek Stupa marks the location where Lord Buddha is believed to have delivered his first sermon after attaining enlightenment. It was built in 500 CE to replace an earlier structure constructed by King Ashoka in 249 CE.

During their Sarnath visit, the G20 guests also visited other holy places in Sarnath, including Buddhist monasteries and the remains of ancient monuments and relics of the Mauryan period, an official of the district administration said.

After their arrival at the Lal Bahadur Shastri Airport here on Sunday, the delegates were accorded a grand welcome with drumbeats and music where volunteers received them by applying 'tikaa' and showering flowers.

India is hosting the conclave of development ministers of the G-20 member nations from June 11-13 in its capacity as the current chair of the grouping.

It is expected to focus on disruptions in global supply chains, food and energy security challenges and impacts of climate change among other issues.",2023-06-13T10:44:00Z

In his keynote address at the G20 Development Ministers' Meeting under India's presidency at Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Trade Facilitation Centre's auditorium here on Monday, the minister said, ""It is essential that we constantly strengthen the international architecture and governance systems for the protection of global order, global laws, and global values.""

""In doing so we would invariably find ourselves on the path where diplomacy, dialogue and cooperation take precedence over competition, conflict and divisions. Choosing peace, cooperation and multilateralism is essential for building our collective future,"" he added.

The G20 needs to play a key role in assuring that this higher purpose remains well within our grasp, said Jaishankar adding that the action plan that was adopted here today in Varanasi would provide such a roadmap for the G20 to galvanise the critical momentum and ambition for these efforts.

On unprecedented and multiple crises in the world today, Jaishankar said, from the pandemics to disruptions in supply chains, from the impact of conflict to climate events, our era is becoming more volatile and uncertain by the day. ""Added to this is stubborn inflation, rising interest rates and shrinking fiscal space for many nations,"" he said adding, ""As always, in such times, the weak and the vulnerable bear the brunt.""

""If progress towards the sustainable development goals (SDGs) was already falling short before Coivid-19, this has only been further exacerbated by it,"" said Jaishankar, adding that climate change also continues unabated, with a disproportionate impact on least developed countries and small island developing states.

Prospects for a global economic recovery remain dim amidst supply chain disruptions, prolonged debt crisis and pressures on energy, food and fertilizer security, he said.

""The Development Ministerial is an opportunity for us as the G20 to demonstrate solidarity on these developmental issues,"" he said, adding, ""The decisions we make today have the potential to contribute to an inclusive, sustainable, and resilient future."" The SDG agenda is a landmark not only in its universality, in that it applies to all countries but also in its integrity, in that it can only be successful as a comprehensive agenda.

Jaishankar also highlighted how India has put forward an ambitious 7-year action plan for accelerating progress on the SDGs. The action plan puts forward transformative actions on the three core agendas, he said, mentioning bold, decisive actions on fostering data for development and digital public infrastructure which are needed around the world to jumpstart innovations at the grassroots level.

""India's own experience with these innovations has transformed our societies and governance in less than half a decade,"" he said, adding, ""Investing in women-led development not only helps to accelerate progress across all the SDGs, but also delivers results on the ground for all sections of society. Securing globally just transitions will help ensure the future survival of the planet, while meeting the aspirations of its diverse people.""

""We, as the G20, need to be bold in our ambition. We need to come together to address the crisis as one. The theme of the Indian Presidency 'One Earth, One Family, One Future' therefore is an urgent call for action,"" said Jaishankar.

Reforming the global governance architecture and reviving global decision-making to be more representative are fundamental for building a future where truly no one is left behind, he said and added that such efforts will facilitate development models wherein no region, no country and no individual will be left behind. These efforts will enable human-centric globalization without creating a climate crisis or debt crisis.",2023-06-13T03:35:00Z

The Hindu,Review of A New Reform Paradigm  --  Festschrift in Honour of Isher Judge Ahluwalia: No to armchair theories ,,"The India growth story was in pieces by 2013. The fallout of the global economic crisis, scams, and political and administrative paralysis soured the investment climate. A decade later, investors still aren't betting their money on it. A collection of essays in A New Reform Paradigm: Festschrift in Honour of Isher Judge Ahluwalia argues that the trouble with the economy runs deeper. Some of India's finest economists write about the problems and how to fix them, busting several myths about the economy popular in public discourse.

Yes, India is the fastest-growing major economy in the world. But will that make India rich? Rakesh Mohan, member, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's economic advisory council, offers some answers: If GDP growth can be accelerated to exceed 8% every year, India will reach a per capita income of $8,500 by the late 2030s, lower than where China is today.

But that is easier said than done. Mohan shows that India, despite the tremendous progress since Independence, has fallen behind most other countries. On life expectancy, India is 30 years behind China and 10 years behind Indonesia. A quarter of the adult population is still illiterate, with obvious implications for their employability. The government is severely stretched, with only 1,600 Central government employees (including those of Railways and PSU banks and companies) per 10,000 Indians, compared with more than 7,500 in the U.S. The elite IAS and IPS cadres comprise only 5,000 officers each.

Stress on manufacturing

The essay about the jobs crisis, the single most important issue that will define Narendra Modi's prime ministership, and India's future, is the book's best. Radhicka Kapoor, who has edited the collection, rejects lazy explanations, such as the slow progress on labour reforms. She shows that if hiring hasn't picked up at manufacturing plants in States such as Rajasthan, where governments have reformed labour laws, it's because firms have learnt to circumvent labour regulations by hiring short-term contract workers, paying them half the wages of directly employed workers.

The case she makes is this: Farming, construction, trade, hotels and restaurants jobs will not make India and Indians rich. Poverty reduced impressively between 2004-05 and 2011-12, when labour quit farms for construction sites, but 83% of construction jobs are casual, only slightly better than agriculture. The ideal type of employment for the masses, therefore, is manufacturing. Productivity of labour in it is about one and half times the economy-wide average, and it can hire people with low to medium levels of education.

Trouble is, it isn't generating too many jobs, and accounts for just 12% of the total workforce. The only way to repair this, Kapoor argues, is to shed the legacy capital intensive industries bias in the industrial policy framework. The Modi government's industrial policy is doing the opposite, she explains, and recommends that it must start encouraging labour-intensive manufacturing instead.

Dr. Ahluwalia (1945-2020) published Industrial Growth in India in 1985, a book that helped shape the technocratic design of the 1991 reforms, particularly the dismantling of controls, and a bigger role for market forces in the economy. Her research work in the 2000s, especially on urban development and climate change, provides a framework for addressing the dissatisfaction with the outcomes of those reforms and building on the successes.

In a personal note for the book, her husband Montek Singh Ahluwalia writes that she was always mindful of the dangers of armchair theorising on policy. The wide-ranging essays reflect a similar approach. The authors offer policy advice on today's pressing problems, taking a broad view of the strong influence of institutions, state behaviour and technologies on changes in economic structure and outcomes. This book is, thus, both a legacy of -- and a tribute to -- an influential policy analyst.

Hindustan Times,UP STF arrests 3 for duping govt job aspirants,,"Lucknow The UP Police Special Task Force (STF) arrested three men on Friday for allegedly swindling unemployed youths of crores of rupees on the promise of providing them government jobs, said officials here on Saturday.

The accused posed as government officials and operated fake offices to dupe youngsters.

According to a press release issued by the STF, the three accused, Abhishek Pratap Singh from Lucknow, Athar Hussain from Sant Kabir Nagar and Neeraj Mishra from Kanpur were arrested from a rented house in Kursi, Barabanki in the early hours of Friday.

Explaining their modus operandi, STF officials said the accused rented a house in a secluded place in cities across Uttar Pradesh and set up a fake office. ""The accused got job advertisements published in newspapers and held interviews at their rented offices. They used to charge ₹ 2-4 lakh from every aspirant on the pretext of giving them jobs in various government departments,"" the statement said.

The accused used to hand over fake appointment, training and posting letters to these youths and also gave ""fake training"" to them. After collecting the money, the accused abandoned the place overnight before targeting job aspirants in some other city.

They said several fake identity cards, fake appointment letters of the ministry of environment, forest and climate change, fake appointment letters of UP Jal Nigam and UP Forest Corporation, fake training letters of National Health Mission and four fake rubber stamps of secretary of UP Forest Corporation were recovered.

""We have partnered with a vendor to dispose of old and unserviceable IT equipment after collecting them from offices, residents, RWAs and market associations. According to the agreement, the company purchases e-waste like discarded mobile phones, monitors, CPUs, printers, etc. from citizens through an online system and ensures its disposal in a proper manner. People who want to use the services can submit a request on an application https://ewaste.mcd.live/ or call on toll free helpline number 155305 for collection,"" an official said.

""Our vendor has so far fulfilled 971 requests and paid nearly Rs 87 lakh. Later, it has sold the collected items to authorized units for scientific disposal. We began the services on June 21 from the erstwhile south corporation and later implemented it in all zones,"" the official said.

The ministry of environment, forest and climate change notified the e-waste management rules of 2016 following which the MCD started this initiative.

Electronic waste contains toxic chemicals and minerals such as arsenic. ""If such an item is not disposed of in a scientific manner, it can cause massive damage to the environment and unscientific disposal can lead to health hazards. These heavy metals can reach groundwater or soil, causing ulcers and cancer,"" the official said.

""The facility is provided by our vendor at residents' doorstep so a person needs not to go anywhere to dispose of their waste stuff. Also, they get paid for selling e-waste on the basis of conditions or rates fixed,"" the official said.",2023-05-08T01:26:00Z
The Times of India,"In 7 Yrs, Hry Failed To Spend ₹10cr To Restore Green Cover | Gurgaon News - Times of India",Ipsita Pati,"GURGAON: Under the Centre's Green India Mission (GIM), Haryana had received Rs 9.5 crore from 2015-16 to 2021-22 to protect and restore the forest cover. But an RTI query filed by Kerala-based RTI campaigner, K. Govindan Nampoothirythe, reveals that the work has not been started yet.

Launched in 2014, the mission undertakes afforestation activities under the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC). The primary aim is to protect, restore and enhance India's diminishing forest cover. The state had then submitted a target of increasing the tree cover by 2,350 hectares and improving the forest quality by 3,824 hectares.

The forest department said the work would be initiated during the monsoon this year and over the next five years, several aspects such as restoration of degraded open forests grasslands and abandoned mining areas will be covered.

""The Haryana government has submitted a proposal and the target is expected to be achieved over the next five years. We will start the plan this year. Work on the target which we had submitted earlier, will start from this year,"" said Suresh Dalal, additional principal chief conservator of forests.

The state has now also increased the target to restoration of 11,272 hectares forest cover in eight districts. As per the plan, Nuh has the largest target area with 2,817 hectares, followed by Bhiwani (2,414 hectares), Rewari (1,602 hectares), Charkhi Dadri (1,375 hectares), Faridabad (989 hectares), Mahendergarh (891 hectares), Palwal (699 hectares) and Gurgaon (485 hectares). This also includes a total of 960 hectares of abandoned mining sites in Nuh and 42 hectares in Faridabad -- to be restored under GIM.

Gurgaon aims at restoring open forests on 132 hectares and carry out agro-forestry across 353 hectares, according to the proposal sent by the forest department to the Centre. The entire project of enhancing the green cover in the Aravalis is estimated to cost Rs 989 crore.

According to the Desertification and Land Degradation Atlas 2021, a total of 8.24% (3,64,154 hectare) of the total geographical area in Haryana has undergone desertification between 2018-19. The desertification and degradation are intensifying because of large-scale illegal mining in the Aravalis, said experts, adding that mining degrades the green cover, leading to climate change. As the mountain range is disappearing because of mining, the intensity of dust storms coming in from the Thar desert is increasing and the region is moving closer to desertification.

Meanwhile, environment experts pointed out that this plan will not bring desirable results. ""Haryana anyway has very little land outside of forest. Also, it is not possible to carry out plantation in private or panchayat land. This will not increase the green areas,"" said former forest conservator of Gurgaon, RP Balwan.

""Forest department has to develop some mechanism to ensure that the plantation drives in private areas get a protected status, otherwise, this whole exercise is of no use. It gives a completely distorted picture of the status of forests,"" Balwan added.",2023-05-07T04:20:00Z
The Hindu,Milma stresses need to step up internal production of milk,,"The Kerala Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (Milma) has underlined the need to increase internal milk production by 15% annually for the next three years to ensure self-sufficiency.

Milk procurement by Milma outdid demand in 2021-22 but dipped by 5% in 2022-23, Milma chairman K. S. Mani said here on Monday.

Milma was depending on Karnataka for additional milk purchases, but a drop in milk procurement there due to the lumpy skin disease in cattle and climate change factors had forced Milma to look elsewhere.

The Times of India,Performance Of Vtr Falls To 'good' Category | Patna News - Times of India,,"PATNA: The rating of Valmiki Tiger Reserve (VTR) in the latest tiger census report released by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday plunged from ""very good"" to ""good"" category in management effectiveness evaluation (MEE) system.

VTR, the only tiger reserve in Bihar, has scored 77.97% in the MEE, putting it at 38th position among the 51 tiger reserves assessed in the latest census report, titled 'Status of Tigers 2022'.

The VTR is among only the three tiger reserves in the country whose performance has gone down. The other two tiger reserves include Nameri in Assam and Udanti-Sitanadi in Chhattisgarh. Altogether 14 tiger reserves have found place in ""good"" category under the MEE system.

VTR director-cum-conservator of wildlife Nesamani K, however, said though the ranking has gone down, it doesn't necessarily reflect that the performance of the tiger reserve is bad. ""The parameters under MEE have been made much more detailed in the 2022 assessment. Besides, the same parameters are used for assessment of all tiger reserves despite different sets of conditions at different places,"" Nesamani told TOI on Monday.

He added, ""There are around 26 villages on the fringes of the VTR, which cannot be relocated in a go. However, this leads to a drop in scoring under MEE. Besides, few man- animal conflicts occurred last year. Nevertheless, we have been good at habitat management, as reflected by the increase in the number of herbivores as well as prey.""

Nesamani hoped that VTR's ranking in MEE would improve significantly in 2024 along with a surge in tiger numbers. The state-wide tiger numbers under the 2022 census were not released in the report on Sunday, but sources said it is likely to come out in July.

A VTR official told TOI that raw data from camera traps has pegged the updated tiger numbers at 51, but the final number is being ascertained after processing of the raw data sent to Wildlife Institute of India (WII).

Under the MEE system, all tiger reserves were assessed on a total 31 parameters, including integration of the tiger reserves in a larger landscape, compliance of statutory requirements, presence of a tiger conservation plan, mitigation of human-wildlife conflicts and assessment of threats.

This was the fifth cycle of MEE under the nationwide tiger estimation exercise in India. Altogether 28 tiger reserves were assessed in the first cycle in 2006, 39 in 2010, 43 in 2014, 50 in 2018 and 51 in 2022.

The rating of VTR under MEE was ""fair"" in 2006 and 2010 and ""very good"" in 2014 and 2018.

""The MEE score of a tiger reserve, in addition to management, is dependent on the context and its geographical location, reflecting upon the trends in its performance and management over a period of time,"" said Ashwini Kumar Chaubey, Union minister of state for environment, forests and climate change in his message in the MEE summary report.",2023-04-11T06:58:00Z

The Times of India,78% Posts Vacant In Pollution Control Board | Patna News - Times of India,,"PATNA: Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB), which has the mandate to ensure clean air, water and overall environment conservation in the state, is virtually gasping for existence owing to acute manpower crunch.

As per the government's reply in the Lok Sabha recently, 206 posts in BSPCB are vacant against the sanctioned strength of 264, leaving a whopping vacancy of 78%, which is the second highest in the country among all state pollution control boards.

Neighbouring Jharkhand has the highest vacancy percentage at 88% with 237 vacant posts out of the sanctioned strength of 271.

BSPCB is functioning with merely 12 permanent technical staff or officials on government payroll, along with four contractual employees. Several existing officers are also on the verge of retirement.

Such a situation is prevailing despite the fact that BSPCB is playing a key role in several ambitious government projects.

For instance, the BSPCB is the nodal agency for formulating policies for achieving carbon neutrality -- a balance between emitting and absorbing carbon from the atmosphere -- in the state by 2070. But new hiring has not been done in BSPCB for years now owing to lack of service rules of the Board as it is an autonomous body.

""The BSPCB was constituted in 1974 but no service rule was made ever. Now, a new service rule has been made and an approval on it is awaited from the government. It has already gone to various departments and we are expecting a final approval on it to come soon,"" BSPCB's chairman Ashok Kumar Ghosh told TOI.

On being asked about the problems due to manpower shortage, Ghosh said: ""It is very disheartening even though the workload or responsibilities have increased. The workforce is, in fact, shrinking as people are getting retired and no new recruitment can be done due to lack of service rules. All our officers and staff are heavily overworked. We work even on holiday but still find it very difficult to handle the entire gamut of work.""

BSPCB's member secretary S Chandrashekhar said, ""The existing workforce is at saturation level and we are mostly dealing with a huge backlog of pending works owing to manpower shortage. We have submitted a draft of the new service rules to the government and are waiting for an approval on it,"" he told TOI. Union minister of state for environment forest and climate change, Ashwini Kumar Choubey, has stated in his reply in the Lok Sabha that the state pollution control boards have an important role to play in the enforcement of Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 and the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.

""Availability of adequate manpower in these institutions is very important for effective discharge of their functions and duties. The responsibility to fill up vacancies lies with the state government concerned,"" Choubey said in reply to the Lok Sabha. On being asked about the vacant posts in BSPCB, chief secretary Amir Subhani told TOI on Friday: ""I will hold a review meeting on the matter and resolve the issue at the earliest.""

Officials in BSPCB claimed that they are much hard-pressed and facing severe difficulties in discharging their duties due to the prevailing manpower crisis.

""We are unable to properly implement the environment protection norms. Public complaints are not being addressed properly.

The Times of India,Patna DM Chandrashekhar Singh asks officials of 15 departments to keep heat disaster task force active | Patna News - Times of India,,"PATNA: Patna district magistrate (DM) Chandrashekhar Singh on Wednesday issued a slew of instructions to officials from as many as 15 departments to initiate measures to provide relief to residents during the scorching heat conditions.

While chairing a meeting of official concerned in the meeting hall of the collectorate here, he assigned responsibilities to the district-level officials of 15 departments and directed them to keep the heat disaster task force active.

The DM said that the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted that the maximum and minimum temperature in most parts of the state are expected to be higher than corresponding normal this summer season. Besides, heatwave warnings are issued by the local unit of the IMD.

""There is a possibility of heat stroke with severe heat during the summer season. Due to this, public life can be affected and they may face problems related to health and drinking water. Especially small children, schoolchildren, pregnant and lactating women and people who go out of home for work, face a lot of problems. Along with this, a situation of drinking water crisis arises,"" the DM said.

""In view of all these, vigil is needed at both administrative and public level according to the standard operating procedure to prevent hassles due to heat during the summer season,"" he added.

The DM asked officials to ensure inter-departmental coordination for error-free disaster management. Instructions were issued to officials from departments, including health, animal and fisheries resources, public health engineering, urban development and housing, education, social welfare, rural development, panchayati raj, transport, energy, labour resources, forest, environment and climate change, fire fighting, and information technology. The DM asked all the officials to ensure that people do not face any problem in extreme heat and heatwave conditions.

""Heatwave action plan is being implemented to prevent health hazards due to hot winds and heat stroke. In view of the possibility of severe heatwave, an 18-member district-level heatwave disaster relief task force has been constituted for public safety. This task force is reviewing the pre-preparations of heatwave and monitoring all works related to relief and rescue of heatwave-affected people,"" DM Singh said.

He added, ""Bulk SMS will be sent through dashboard to make people aware about protection from heat and heat stroke. Arrangements will be made by the additional district magistrate, disaster management to receive early warning of heatwave from the local unit of the India Meteorological Department and to send its information to all the major stakeholders. Besides, pre-warning of heatwave will be given to people by the district disaster management cell through television, radio, print media, press release and SMS among others.""",2023-04-06T01:59:00Z
The Hindu,"Chart your own course, Tamil Nadu Governor tells youths ",,"Tamil Nadu Governor R. N. Ravi on Monday asked youths to chart their own course, rather than looking at inheriting it from others.

Addressing the G20 Young Ambassador Summit 2023 organised by Sri Krishna College of Engineering and Technology in Coimbatore on the theme ""Fuelling the Future of Global Youth"", Mr. Ravi asked the students ""Do you want a future that is given to you, in which you will have limited space? You must create this space because you have to live in this.""

The Governor asked them to come up with recommendations that could influence the actions of the leaders of G20. ""The G20 is a powerful group. It can change the destiny of the world.,"" he said.

Prior to this regime at the Centre, India had only around 500 start-ups. But, it was now set to touch the one lakh mark. He added that India's way of seeing the country as one family would be invaluable in its G20 presidency.

Union Minister of State for Fisheries L. Murugan said the Young Ambassador Summit 2023 holds a special place among all the G20 events. He said India, with its G20 presidency, was focused on finding a global solution for the well-being of all. The world is facing many challenges like climate change, destruction of biodiversity and under-nourishment, and India could provide hope in addressing many of these issues, he said.

G20 Sherpa of India Amitabh Kant said India had been able to digitise its economy in a big way. Over a billion people have digital identity today. Between 2015-17, 500 million bank accounts were created. It was ensured that more than 900 million mobile phones did quick digital payments. In 8 years, India had built about 30 million houses, 110 million toilets and 243 million people got access to piped water supply. Roads to an extent of 55,000 km were laid.

All these are massive transformations that would have normally taken 50 years, but were achieved in 8 years, he said quoting the Bank of International Settlement.

Welcoming the gathering, S. Malarvizhi, Chairperson of Sri Krishna Institutions said her institution was fortunate to have successful leaders from diverse fields taking part in the summit.",2023-03-20T15:22:00Z
The Times of India,Rajaji Tiger Reserve set to have first private forest biosphere | Dehradun News - Times of India,,"DEHRADUN: The Rajaji Tiger Reserve (RTR) is all set to have its first private forest biosphere. The initiative, which was inaugurated in the presence of Uttarakhand forest minister Subodh Uniyal on Saturday, is spread across 35 acres of agricultural land located in Baddiwala, on the southern side of RTR which is home to a significant elephant population besides leopards, tigers and ungulates.

The brainchild of Delhi-based environmentalist Jai Dhar Gupta, founding member of citizens' movement, 'My Right to Breathe', Rajaji Raghati Biosphere (RRB), as the project is called, intends to provide an additional buffer forest to Rajaji. The project envisages creating a commune for wildlife, forest, climate science and other environmental experts.

""The goal of RRB is to evolve as a living ecosystem, a model for global cohabitation and a small response to climate change. For now, the simple goals include growing and guarding the forest, restoring rare tree species, measuring ecological succession, climate science research, proving coexistence and creating carbon sinks,"" said Gupta. He added, ""In the long-term, a sustainable forest mosaic will be created that will have at least 6,000 trees apart from various climber plants, shrubs and grass. The biosphere will have only native trees and plants of RTR."" As part of the initial phase, nearly 300 saplings were planted on Saturday. A team of RRB also visited RTR to collect seeds of rare and endangered species of trees and plants found only in that landscape.",2023-03-05T00:27:00Z
The Hindu,TANSIM to work on city-based funds,,"The Tamil Nadu Startup Innovation Mission (TANSIM) plans to facilitate city-based funds in five cities in the State to support startups.

Sivarajah Ramanathan, Mission Director and Chief Executive Officer of TANSIM, told The Hindu here recently that it wanted to work on city-based funds where a group of investors could create a corpus to invest in startups, irrespective of the location of the startup. Though there was no size for the corpus, it had to be minimum ₹20 crore to be viable.

The Startup Innovation Mission also started an exercise to mine data of startups in 30 different sectors. The proposal was to have a desk for each of the 30 verticals based on the data collected and create a forum of stakeholders for each sector. This would help come out with policy initiatives and targeted projects for each sector.

The government also supported women-led startups with several programmes. Under the current edition of the seed fund programme, about 50 startups that were women led or in rural impact or climate change segments would be supported. Apart from this, women-led startups also got support if they were in an incubator facility, Mr. Ramanathan said.",2023-03-02T15:41:00Z
Hindustan Times,"India, UAE working to finalise rupee-dirham arrangement for trade: Envoy",,"NEW DELHI: India and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are engaged in technical discussions to finalise a rupee-dirham arrangement for trade as part of the efforts to build on the free trade agreement signed by the two countries last year, UAE ambassador Abdulnasser Jamal Alshaali said in an interview.

The UAE is also keen on revisiting the arrangement for flights to India and introducing flights to more Indian destinations to help bring down airfare, Alshaali said. The envoy further said the UAE has played a role in the past in addressing tensions between India and Pakistan, though any future role in this regard would be up to both countries. Edited excerpts:

What are the new areas that India and the UAE are looking at? Could you tell us about the UAE's participation in the G20 as a guest country?

This is the second year in a row that we are participating in G20 as a guest country and I think the lessons that everyone has been taking from this is we are even much better organised internally now to manage such participation. The first participation was in 2011, also as a guest country, but we were chairing the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) at the time and it was the French presidency. Then it was the Saudi Arabian presidency [in 2020], and we were chairing GCC. Last year with Indonesia and this year with India, we were invited as a guest country. Doing it three times in four [different] years gave us a better momentum internally in terms of who's in charge of what, the two separate tracks, the working groups, high-level participation and so on. As of now, in India, the official taking part in working group meetings has always been at the ministerial level and we haven't downgraded that at any point and this is going to continue all the way to the summit.

As far as the relationship goes, I think one thing that captures this is that we have a minister visiting almost every month, if not two ministers. For example, we had (minister of state for foreign trade) Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi and Minister of State Ahmed bin Ali Al Sayegh coming to the Uttar Pradesh Investor Summit. We had minister Thani going to Bangalore to inaugurate the Ducab Grpoup's office. We had Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan last November. We have the head of the Federal National Council coming in next month, and [Sheikh Abdullah] coming in [for the G20 foreign ministers meeting]. You can see there is quite some momentum here. The political relationship is obviously great. But what we are also working on is expanding economic and trade ties and to keep doing so over the coming years.

Are there any particular issues that the UAE would like to highlight while participating in this year's G20?

We want to be an active participant and we want to be a part of the G20's social fabric. Given where the UAE stands today, regionally and globally, I believe we have quite a strong position to navigate all of the turbulence, regardless of what's happening around the globe, and we're able to bridge various opinions and different points of view.

Where does bilateral trade stand almost a year after the signing of the India-UAE comprehensive economic partnership agreement (CEPA)? What is being done to build on this?

At the moment we are at $44 billion in non-oil trade. The target is $100 billion by 2027. The reason we use this figure is because there is a strong partnership in terms of energy security and oil export to India. The figure that we focus on is non-oil. We want to make sure we're investing in the various sectors that are important to both countries, whether they fall within the CEPA or they don't fall within it. We want to make sure we expand the aviation ties, we want to invest in food security and by extension, food park projects in different states. Part of this also is taking the CEPA and raising awareness about it. It's been almost a year since the implementation of the CEPA and you want to max out on that and you want to see if there are more things to be done. We just launched the UAE chapter of the UAE-India Business Council, we're going to also launch the UAE-India CEPA Council, which is part of the CEPA mandate and that would be looking specifically at sectors that both countries want to focus on as part of the CEPA framework.

Have you kind of identified any sectors in this regard?

Space, defence, food security, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, cultural engagements - those are the main ones. There's also energy security for both countries, which includes renewable energy.

There has been a demand for several years now for revisiting the aviation arrangements between India and the UAE as the flights have been maxed out. Has there been any progress on this?

The conversation has been ongoing for quite some time now, and you're right, both sides have maxed out. UAE airlines have maxed out, Indian airlines have maxed out and you can see it from the prices. If you check the price of a ticket today, it's more than 50% higher than it used to be a few years back or it used to be pre-Covid. That's already a market signal which we need to pay attention to because we are talking about this entire relationship and aviation is a crucial point in expanding this relationship. If you can't make sure that you have enough flights and enough seat capacity on this route, then it's very difficult to expand anything else.

There is also a request from the UAE side to fly to more destinations in India?

There is. It's not just expanding the current capacity, but also to additional points. Again, this is an ongoing conversation and the aviation sector in India has been going through privatisation. There are all kinds of agreements happening and we understand that, but this is something important for both markets because otherwise, I don't see how prices are going to go down anytime because it's a simple demand-supply question.

Any progress on the rupee-dirham arrangement for trade? Has anything been worked out?

The technical conversation is ongoing. There has been an agreement to settle a certain [amount] of trade between the two countries, just not having to go through a third currency. Let's see, this conversation is an ongoing conversation at the technical level and how they can proceed with it. We also have the remittance facility to make it more direct and easier. There's still technical issues to be discussed and agreed on.

Given that the UAE is set to host COP28, how do you plan to ramp up cooperation with India on renewable energy? Is there any particular area that you're looking at, such as wind or solar energy?

It's everything. What we're trying to do is to be a part of India's goal and achieving their renewable energy target. At the same time, the UAE is expanding its renewable energy investments worldwide. We are in 40 countries and we want to make sure that we expand our portfolio in different countries.

In terms of COP28, the main focus that we have at the moment is how can we find areas of cooperation and expand on them that overlap between the G20 and the COP28 presidency. We're supporting India's presidency and the Indian government has been doing great in managing the engagements and obviously, we can count on India's support in the COP28 presidency as well.

Can India and the UAE also work together on funding technology transfers to developing countries as part of climate transition?

One thing that India has been focusing on is South-South cooperation, which is why also they came out with the theme of [being the] voice of the Global South. In that sense, you could tell even from the countries that have been invited to the G20 that this is an area of focus. You can't work on aspects that impact those countries without having those countries as part of the conversation. As the UAE, we stand in a very good position to navigate all of that. We are able to relate to what troubles the countries of the Global South and at the same time be able to bridge them with developed nations.

Is any work underway to build on India's arrangement with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) for strategic energy reserves?

It is where it is right now. It's been a major success for the relationship. Energy security is important both for the UAE and for India, and we want to be part of India's energy security. The fact that the strategic oil reserve has been agreed on and it's been established and has been ongoing for quite some time, it is quite helpful and constructive, especially given the current state of affairs. I think this was probably, on both sides, a very good foresight into the future and making sure that you know we stabilise the market for our partner.

Any talk [on expanding the arrangement] would be at a technical level, but obviously, this will be up to the Indian government and how they want to take this forward.

Could you tell us more about the UAE's plans to invest in food parks and renewable energy in India under the I2U2 framework? Has the practical work for this started?

The Gujarat government shared a proposal on specific food commodities and their levels of production and those were shared with [the holding company] ADQ on the sidelines of the I2U2 Business Forum, which took place in Abu Dhabi last week. There was also a conversation between ADQ and officials from Gujarat, so the conversation is ongoing.

ADQ has been the one involved in food parks for quite some time. The initial problem has been that this has been passed on quite a few times, but now ADQ is the main stakeholder from UAE and they have recently met on the sidelines of the I2U2 Business Forum.

Would these investments be in Gujarat or would you also look at other states?

Well, for now, it's Gujarat. But then, if it works in Gujarat and this seems quite feasible, then this can be expanded elsewhere because the whole idea is looking into food security and establishing the infrastructure for better logistics, better shipping, etc. If it works and it's easy, then replicate it everywhere else.

The pandemic showed the importance of food security because the Indian side continued to supply food to the UAE despite disruptions.

This is the connection that I was trying to make between energy security and food security. Food security is important for us. We don't produce that much food and we import a lot of it. And it's quite vital for us that we have a partner that we can rely on, and India is a reliable partner when it comes to that.

How does the India-France-UAE trilateral plan to ramp up cooperation in areas such as climate change, green technologies and defence?

It is in a very early stage when it comes to the official part of it. As a conversation, this probably has been mentioned here and there a few times. We don't want to just focus on the bilateral aspect of the relationship with India, but we want to expand other forums. So we want to look into multilateral stuff. I2U2, for example, is a great platform for trilateral cooperation. The main idea here is you have excellent relations with certain countries. We have excellent relations with certain countries. France has excellent relations with certain countries, and we want to leverage the commonalities between all of those, whether it's country-wise or sector-wise.

Specifically in defence cooperation, are you looking at joint development of hardware?

The conversation is still going on. We had a high-level visit last September, so they came here and met with their counterparts and they moved around. They're looking at everything. We have our own production capabilities. India is big on ""Make in India"" in terms of defence production. What we're trying to find or work on in the future is also expanding this area of cooperation.

In terms of people-to-people contacts and cooperation in education, what's on the table to take things forward?

We have been working on the cultural exchanges and making sure there's people-to-people contacts. That people can easily fly between the two countries. We want to also see more Indians coming in to study in the UAE.

We want to always have some sort of exhibition taking place, whether it's in the UAE or in India. For instance, we recently had the Bollywood exhibition at the Louvre in Abu Dhabi and we want to keep that kind of engagement going. We recently had Jindal Global University sign an MoU with the Anwar Gargash Diplomatic Academy. IIT-Delhi would be meeting with the Diplomatic Academy as well. At the moment, [IIT-Delhi officials] are touring Abu Dhabi for their [planned] campus. Those are ongoing engagements and we want to make sure that we maximize on them.

At a time when growing numbers of Indian students are going to Europe for further studies, what is the UAE's unique selling point when it comes to attracting them?

I think the unique selling point here is that we have global universities based in Abu Dhabi and Dubai and we are just three hours away. There're cultural similarities. People have been living in the area for quite some time. We have Emiratis living in India, even though in a much smaller number. When you look at it, why would you send your kids to study 11 hours away when you could just send them to a place three hours away? We have France's Sorbonne University, the New York University from the US and a few British schools and if you have IIT-Abu Dhabi as well, then there you go.

Are there any new initiatives to boost cooperation in the fight against terrorism and radicalisation?

For both countries, counter-terrorism is important and this has been very clear from everything that came out from both countries. In all cases, this will always be an area of interest for us, as much as it is for India and we will always continue to look into how we can expand our cooperation.

The Pakistan prime minister recently spoke about asking the UAE leadership to help build a bridge with India. There were reports that the UAE and Saudi Arabia helped reduce tensions between India and Pakistan in 2019. Where does the UAE see itself in this process?

So our relationship is good both ways, right? And we have played such a role in the past, but again this is going to be up to both countries and whether this is something that they would want us to do or not. But as a country, we continue to maintain very good relations with both countries.",2023-02-28T14:47:00Z
Hindustan Times,Greater global growth on India's G20 agenda,,"India's presidency of G20 is off to a good start. Around 30 meetings in 20 locations have already taken place. The first meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors was successfully held in Bengaluru, and the first foreign ministers' meeting is due to commence shortly. The outcomes of these meetings will feed into the summit scheduled in New Delhi in September.

G20, which took its current shape in 2008, is seen as an effective global governance forum and an increasingly influential voice in the world economy. Its relevance is evident when compared to existing global governance institutions that are unequal to the challenge of tackling contemporary geopolitical tensions and crises such as climate emergencies.

As G20 completes 15 years of existence, it faces the task of reviving and sustaining global growth in the face of the devastation wrought by the double whammy of the pandemic and the Ukraine war. The persisting threat of recession across geographies, the debt crises in developing countries and contestation in trade and technology complicate the task.

Accelerated economic growth is key, given the fear of recession. In December, World Bank stated that at the end of 2021, external debt of the heavily indebted poor countries totalled $9 trillion. It blamed rising interest rates and slowing global growth for the debt crisis, adding that about 60% of the poorest countries were already at high risk of debt distress or already in distress. This certainly makes a case for inclusive and resilient growth - one that will cushion the shocks of business cycles, future black swan events, the vagaries of the climate crises and geopolitical tensions. As G20 president, India will look to focus on areas where it can bring in structural transformations, propelling greater growth, prosperity and equity.

One key ingredient is increased trade. Expanding protectionism and trade barriers had already impacted the world economy before the pandemic roiled supply chains. The Ukraine war only exacerbated these stresses with fuel, fertiliser and food shortages. Against this backdrop, the need of the hour is a strong signal favouring transparent, fair and rules-based trade. Underlining G20 support to the World Trade Organization will be key to this. India believes that the rules-based multilateral trading system is a force of good, helping big and small countries, including developing ones. Increased trade will achieve inclusive growth, sustain innovation, create jobs and help make progress in sustainable development goal targets.

The New Delhi G20 summit will be a good opportunity for India to showcase its public digital platforms that can be modified and scaled up or down to help governments provide essential public services to citizens. The world over, there is a realisation that digital technology is a driver of economic growth and empowerment across sectors. The world needs new, knowledge-driven and innovative approaches to tackle complex challenges, and digital technologies present us with the tools to deal with some of them.

Another ingredient for accelerated growth is the increased integration of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in world trade. World Bank data shows that small and medium firms play a critical role, especially in developing countries. They represent about 90% of all businesses and are responsible for 50% of employment worldwide. Many are vital cogs in international supply chains and are often the most dynamic businesses. However, they face constraints such as access to finance that stymies growth. Access to resources is imperative and India supports the need for international financial institutions to be more receptive to the funding demands of MSMEs. Indeed, the reform of multilateral financial institutions, to make them more responsive to the requirements of the Global South, will be high on the agenda of the presidency.

Just like trade, investment too is a driver of global growth. A prerequisite for attracting investment is a conducive climate that takes into account the needs of businesses and workers and creates a win-win situation for investors and the entire economic ecosystem. The pandemic resulted in the loss of jobs worldwide, pushing millions into poverty. India, too, faced a difficult situation which resulted in the government formulating the Code on Social Security, 2020. This was seen as a radical piece of labour reform, mandating social protection for all workers, including new-age gig and platform workers (India had 476 million such workers in 2021) for one of the world's largest and youngest working populations. India's implementation of this measure could serve as an example for other countries. Skilling and reskilling of workers to make them future-ready for a new job market is also a major challenge. International collaboration is the most likely answer as India and the world adapt to the increasing demand for a workforce adept at utilising emerging technologies.

If the Ukraine war showed us that commodities such as food and fertilisers are vulnerable to shocks, so did the climate crisis. The Bali G20 Declaration called for an accelerated transformation towards sustainable and resilient agriculture, food systems and supply chains. It also committed to protecting the most vulnerable from hunger as food and fertiliser prices spiked.

India will aim to expand on this commitment during its presidency. India supplied foodgrains to countries in its near and extended neighbourhood during the pandemic in the spirit of its G20 presidency's theme of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam - One Earth, One Family, One Future. To cope with the impact of climate shocks on farming, India promoted climate resilient varieties of crops, specifically millets. Acting on India's proposal, the United Nations declared 2023 as the International Year of Millets. India could also use the G20 platform to highlight some measures it took to further the economic well-being of its farmers.

India's G20 presidency comes at a very critical juncture. There is an expectation that India, the fastest-growing large economy in the world, which has implemented some of the most innovative and far-reaching measures to improve governance and living standards, will be in a position to contribute solutions to the global challenges of the day. As a bridge between the developed and developing worlds, India stands ready to share its experiences for the good of the world community.",2023-02-26T17:27:00Z
The Times of India,Ita: Focus On Actions Aligned With India's Green Economy Position: Ita To Tea Industry | Guwahati News - Times of India,,"Guwahati: The Indian Tea Association (ITA) has called upon the tea industry to focus on actions aligned with the country's position as a 'green and conscious major economy'.

Speaking at the 132nd annual general meeting of the Assam Branch of ITA (ABITA) in Jorhat on Saturday, ITA chairperson Nayantara Palchoudhuri said, ""As sustainability takes centrestage globally, our industry needs to focus on actions aligned with India's position as a green and conscious major economy.

The tea industry needs to gradually assimilate itself with the green hydrogen mission, which is set to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and accelerate transition towards a low-carbon intensity eco-system.""

The ABITA meeting was held at a time state is observing the bicentennial of the state's tea industry.

The chairperson commended the sensitivity of the state government towards the needs of the industry, and lauded chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma for the progressive move of enhancing the orthodox incentive under the Assam Tea Industries Special Incentives Scheme (ATISIS), 2020.

She said the continuation of the scheme beyond March 31 is crucial to ensure the industry's viability.

She also pointed out that ""soaring costs of production without matching price realizations amidst the perpetual increase in input costs is a retarding factor for growth"".

""Climate change issues such as declining yields, pest infestation as also the increased dependence on irrigation are additional worries. Therefore, a long-term strategy to address the challenges at hand and preparing the roadmap for sustenance is crucial,"" she added.

She said according to available data, Guwahati auction prices of last year have shown a moderate increase from 2021.",2023-02-20T03:27:00Z
The Times of India,BSPCB to sign MoU with BHU for Patna's air quality assessment | Patna News - Times of India,,"PATNA: The Bihar State Pollution Control Board (BSPCB) is all set to ink a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Banaras Hindu University (BHU), Varanasi, to properly assess the city's emissions and even predict pollution sources and levels almost three days in advance.

The initiative has been taken to set up the system of air quality forecasting and research (SAFAR), which provides location specific information on air quality in near real time and also gives forecast for the next 72 hours. Led by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) Pune, in association with the India Meteorological Department (IMD), it serves as the forecaster of pollution trends in Delhi, Mumbai, Pune and Ahmedabad.

Member secretary of the BSPCB, S Chandrashekhar, said based on the evaluation of proposal sent by the institutes, the expert committee comprised scientist, professors of IIT- Kanpur, IIT-Kharagpur, chairman of the Board Ashok Ghosh and BHU, to conduct the study on various parameters of air pollution.

""The MoU between the BSPCB and the BHU will be signed by this month, following which field survey will be conducted to identify all possible sources of pollution within the city boundary. Apart from conducting emission inventory, carrying capacity and source apportionment of particulate matter pollution, the experts will also collect data on contribution of river bed material (soil) and source of road dust. The study will help us with data and insight into the pattern of pollution,"" he told this newspaper on Saturday.

Chandrashekhar said that as the states and cities falling under the Indo-Gangetic Plains are worst affected due to air pollution mainly because of dust, it is important to conduct study of river bed material. ""Such study has never been conducted anywhere. In Bihar, Himalayan river brings lot of silt deposition and it is remain suspended in the air for long. Besides, it is also important to understand the road dust and from where it came. After collecting all these data, it will be sent to IITM through IMD, to feed and run the data in machine learning (artificial intelligence) in order to start air forecasting system in Patna,"" he said.

Health hazardous pollutants, including PM 10 (particulate matter less than 10 microns) and PM 2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 microns are considered more dangerous as these can penetrate into the lungs and enter the bloodstream), are monitored by SAFAR.

In the first phase, the system will be launched in Patna and all six continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations will be linked to SAFAR. The other non-attainment cities including Muzaffarpur and Gaya will be covered in latter phases.

The digital screens will not only give the real time data of air quality but also the pollution forecast for next three days, with the aim to increase awareness among the public about the air quality in the city, and measures can be taken by the concerned departments to improve the air quality and related health issues. The BSPCB will also create a digital platform to send notification to the concerned department to take immediate action according to the climate action plan made for the city, based on the forecast.",2023-02-19T00:32:00Z

To be sure, India remains an agrarian economy. In fiscal 2022, agriculture and allied sectors accounted for 15-16% of the gross value added and employed ~46% of its population.

For the farming community and rural population, allocations under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Department of Fertilizers and Ministry of Rural Development are most critical.

The growth in these allocations bears out the focus on the agriculture sector and rural development. While the overall budget has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11% in the past decade (fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2023), these allocations have increased at a CAGR of ~12%.

Given its importance to the economy, the sector is expected to lead the government's agenda in Union Budget 2023-24 as well.

Among the top priorities for the sector this time around are:

Sharper focus on R&D in agri input sectors such as fertiliser

Top among the agricultural input sectors is fertiliser, which is highly subsidised. Subsidy for the fertiliser sector is estimated to account for ~5% of the total budget outlay this fiscal against an estimated 4% the previous fiscal.

Among the fertiliser segments, urea takes a lion's share of the subsidy outlay. In recent years, subsidy bills for the non-urea fertiliser segment have also increased. The highly subsidised environment for urea has skewed usage towards Nitrogen(N), leading to a much wider N:P:K ratio of 7.3:3:1 (FY22) against the widely accepted ratio of 4:2:1.

The allocation under research and development (R&D) in fertiliser, however, is a mere Rs 1 million, which is negligible considering the fillip innovations are offering. Take nano urea, for instance, where a 500 ml bottle can replace a 45 kg bag of subsidised urea at a lower price, with efficacy to the tune of 80% -- this can be a game changer for the industry and the economy.

Therefore, the budget needs to be forward looking, with stronger emphasis on R&D to come up with such innovative products. Not only will it decrease government subsidy significantly, but also reduce our dependence on imports. Similarly, in pesticides, an attractive Production Linked Incentive scheme can be considered. In addition, generous incentives can be given to export-oriented firms, considering exports in this industry have logged a CAGR of 18% over fiscals 2012 to 2022.

In seeds, too, R&D and extension services need attention to reduce the costs incurred by farmers for cultivation. For example, development of a perennial rice variety PR23 in China is likely to change the dynamics of the rice market. This variety is expected to reduce the cost of labour, seeds and boost soil health as well, maintaining yield at 8 tonne per hectare, 2.5 times the average rice yield in India for all the claimed eight harvests of the current varieties.

Increase in coverage of price support schemes

With 40-45% of the total paddy and wheat produced in India getting procured at minimum support price (MSP), acreage under these crops has logged a CAGR of 0.4% in the past two decades.

On the contrary, acreage under millets has declined at 5% CAGR over the same period owing to lack of government support. With 2023 earmarked as the 'international year of millets', the budget needs to focus on schemes to promote these climate-smart crops.

Similarly, diversification to other crops such as oilseeds and pulses needs to be incentivised to reduce dependency on imports.

Emphasis on agriculture technologies

With better access to technology at the ground level, there needs to be a greater emphasis on using farm mechanisation, drones and Internet of Things to boost agriculture. The number of centres for custom hiring, hi-tech hubs and farm machinery banks has increased over years to facilitate support to farmers. However, the feasibility of technological advancements such as these is low at the farmer level considering the ground reality, where ~86% of farmers in the country are small and marginal. Therefore, plans to introduce advanced technology at a cluster level through centres, where a single entity would be responsible for monitoring the farms through the IoT and carrying out drone applications, can be introduced and supported.

Digitalisation of agriculture

Digitalisation of the agriculture sector is the need of the hour, especially digitisation of land records and farmer accounts, which can be used for disbursement of incentives under schemes such as PM Kisan and fertiliser subsidies, besides for crop insurance.

Inclusion of tenant farmers is also very important to ensure the support is extended to authentic beneficiaries. Other aspects such as e-commerce for purchase of inputs and selling the produce online through platforms such as eNAM need to be optimised and made farmer-friendly.

Climate change and sustainability

With rising levels of pollution and increasing incidence of severe weather conditions such as heat waves and erratic monsoon, issues such as climate change and sustainability need greater focus.

Emphasis on long-term measures such as usage of renewable energy sources for farm practices and prevention of stubble burning should be incentivised to promote eco-friendly ways of farming. Investment in research and development to bring in climate smart crops should be prioritised.

Additionally, public-private partnership for investment in climate-smart agriculture should be in focus in the upcoming budget.

To conclude, the right cocktail of measures outlined here can give a sustained fillip to the sector for year to come. The budget sure holds the key.

The Times of India,CSIR-NCL celebrates the 73rd Foundation Day - Times of India,,"PUNE: CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory (CSIR-NCL), Pune, recently celebrated its 73rd Foundation Day.

Ajit Kembhavi, Professor Emeritus and Former Director, IUCAA, Pune, delivered the Foundation Day oration on ""From Galileo to the James Webb Space Telescope: The Forward March of Astronomy."" A website for the Central Analytical Facility was also launched at the hands of the chief guest.

In his speech, Kembhavi talked about how astronomy has moved forward from the time of Galileo Galilei (who first did his observations) in 1609 to the present time. He highlighted the discovery of Jupiter's satellites: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.

He said that imaging, photometry, spectroscopy, polarimetry, and variability studies are the major tools of an astronomer. He talked about different telescopes, including Great Forty-Foot Telescope developed by William Herschel. He gave a couple of examples of modern telescopes like reflecting telescope, Himalayan Chandra Telescope, Palomar, 5m Hale Telescope, Very Large Telescope (VLT) from Cerro Paranal Chile, Segmented Mirror Telescopes like the Keck Telescope and Betelgeuse Telescope, Thirty Meter Telescope, Hubble Space Telescope, James Webb Space Telescope (launched in December 2021).

Earlier, in his welcome remarks, professor Ashish Lele, Director, CSIR-NCL, provided brief updates on significant progress made in projects aligned with the roadmap of CSIR-NCL for the 2020-2030 decade. The roadmap was developed keeping in mind the key challenges and opportunities presented to Indian Chemical and allied industries in view of some of the global megatrends such as climate change, sustainability, energy transition, supply chain disruption, self-reliance and the emerging deep tech innovation system, etc.",2023-01-25T05:53:00Z

The Times of India,Genome sequencing to play key role in fight against cancer: Mande | Nagpur News - Times of India,,"Nagpur: Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) of 1,008 individuals, from different ethnic groups of India, has been completed so far under the IndiGen initiative, which was launched in 2019. In the next two years, scientists aim to collect genome data of up to 1 lakh individuals under the initiative.

These WGS data can bring path-breaking developments in the fight against cancer and other major diseases, said Shekhar Mande, former Director General of Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). He was speaking to the media on the sidelines of the 108th Indian Science Congress. The WGS project is a brainchild of Mande.

""We conducted the first phase of this project to let the world know that India has a capacity to conduct WGS. The subsequent phases are expected to deliver cost-effective genetic tests, carrier screening applications for expectant couples, enabling efficient diagnosis of heritable cancers and pharmacogenetic tests to prevent adverse drug reactions,"" said Mande. In India, seven crore people have genetic disorders, and the invention may help them, he added.

Dr Mande also said that efforts are on to make India TB-free by 2025. ""We are working on three points -- rapid diagnosis, vaccination and medicine. We are focusing more on medicines because the directly observed therapy (DOT) has been found working well to eliminate TB,"" he said.

The Chennai-based National institute of research in TB is conducting clinical trials of improved BCG vaccines, indigenously developed for the Indian population.

With the National institute of Environment Engineering and Research (NEERI) based in Nagpur, Dr Mande spoke extensively about environmental issues. ""India's economy will become carbon neutral by the year 2070. By now, we have done very well as compared to the other countries in order to complete the Paris Agreement goals,"" Mande claimed.

He said that the present carbon capturing technology itself consumes a considerable amount of energy, which makes the entire exercise futile. As a result, we need to develop new energy efficient technology to deal with the issue.

""But we have done a spectacular job in biofuel. We are among the only two countries in the world to use the bio-aviation fuel in commercial as well as Air Force aircrafts,"" said Mande.

Being a Nagpurian, Dr Mande announced an innovative project for the city, to be implemented in association with NEERI. ""The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has allotted land near the flower market for the project. With the help of technical support of NEERI, a small unit would be set up to manufacture incense sticks from flower waste. Flowers from city temples can also be brought here for reuse,"" he added.",2023-01-06T23:26:00Z
The Times of India,Drive Against Plastic To Begin In Mango | Ranchi News - Times of India,,"Jamshedpur: The Mango Notified Area Committee (MNAC) will take up fresh drive to stop use of single-use plastic items in its command area from coming week. The local urban municipal body of Mango conducted search and seizure exercises randomly at regular intervals in 2022, but the use of banned plastic items continues.

""This year we will carry out the drive in a focused way. Awareness on the damage to ecology on using the single-use plastic items will also be increased,"" said city manager, MNAC, Jitendra Kumar. The official said that at picnic spots, sanitation teams found people using thermocol plates, bowls and glasses.

""Last week, 5 kg of banned plastic items was seized from the market. We have warned the shopkeepers not to use the single-use plastic items threatening them with fines on the repeat offence,"" Kumar said.

Further, the official said that along with search and seizure exercise, awareness programmes will be organised at different platforms all through the year, aiming to make people an integral part of the drive, which is expected to be launched this week.

The Union ministry of forest, environment and climate change imposed nationwide ban from July 1, 2022, on decorative thermocol cups, cutlery, glasses and wrapping films that are widely in use in the reception parties, besides earbuds, candy and ice cream sticks, among other things.

The Times of India,"World Population: World now has 8 billion humans, Why it may not be bad news | India News - Times of India",,"NEW DELHI: 8000000000 -- that's how many humans live on Earth as of November 15, 2022, give or take.

The global population on Tuesday hit the imposing 8-billion mark, doubling in about 48 years from the time it hit the 4 billion mark in 1974. It was also the fastest addition of 1 billion humans to the population.

It took just 11 years for humans to add another 1 billion humans to the planet. It was in October 2011 when the world population hit the 7 billion milestone.

""The growth of our population is a testament to humanity's achievements, including reductions in poverty and gender inequality, advancements in health care, and expanded access to education,"" the United Nations Population Fund said.

Just how much the global population has exploded over the last century is clear from the chart below.

At the turn of the 19th century, there were just about 1.6 billion humans on the planet. Which means that global population has risen almost 5-fold since the early 1990s.

However, the UN estimates that population growth may now begin to slow.

Billionaire Elon Musk presented a rather stark view on this, saying that the world's population is at the risk of collapse due to low birth rates.

According to estimates, it could take 15 years to reach 9 billion. And another 21 years from 9 to 10 billion.

The UN says the population decline is driven by low and falling fertility levels.

Some projections show that the global population will peak at 10.43 billion by the end of the 21st century and then the growth will start declining.

India set to overtake China

China and India are the two most populous countries in the world, with both of them making up over 36% of the total population.

According to the United Nations, India's population will overtake China's during 2023.

China's population will hit the saturation point this year, which means that from now on, it is projected to start shrinking.

On the other hand, India's population will continue to soar and is not expected to start declining before 2064.

Numbers show that the less developed regions of the world added more people to the population compared to the developed countries.

High-income countries used to be home to 28% of the population in 1950, and now have just 16%.

Low and lower middle income countries have 53% of the world's population now, up from 36% in 1950.

Now, for the verdict

Doomsayers, environmentalists and other activists fear that the 8 billion mark portends a demographic disaster.

But there are many arguments which paint a not-so-gloomy picture about the rise in global population. In fact, some feel that it is actually a good thing.

In his TOI+ column, Swaminathan Aiyar, citing economist Julian Simon, wrote that human ingenuity is the greatest resource, not land, food, or minerals.

""Short-term scarcities will constantly occur, induce more investment and research into alternatives, and hence increase supply, replacing scarcity by abundance,"" he said.

The basis for the argument is that despite a growth in population, the world is facing an increasing abundance of resource and not scarcity.

In fact, the growth at which the resources are being generated is greater than the rate at which the population is growing.

""Between 1980 and 2020, world population grew 75% but time-prices of 50 key commodities fell 75%. For every percentage increase in population, global resource abundance increased 8%.

""That confirms Simon's thesis that people are not a burden on but creators of resources,"" Aiyar wrote.

In an article titled ""The world's population has reached 8bn. Don't panic"", the Economist said that longer lives, improvements in nutrition and public health; falls in infant mortality, disease and maternal deaths in childbirth are behind the population growth.

It noted that even during the Covid pandemic, the population growth did not deaccelerate. Thus, there was not much indication of a demographic disaster.

About the environmental impact of 8 billion humans, The Economist said that the developing world pollute far less than the developed.

""According to the UN, poor and lower-middle-income countries account for only a seventh of the world's emissions of carbon dioxide. But 90% of population growth over the next decade will come from these less-polluting countries,"" it said.

This means that there is little evidence that population growth contributes as much to global warming as rising living standards do.

It noted that while does face issues of environmental degradation and political upheaval, the 8 billion mark does not mean demographic disaster. It said the earth is actually ""having something of a Goldilocks moment: neither too hot nor too cold.""",2022-11-15T09:03:00Z
The Hindu,Mutual benefit: On India-U.S. cooperation on trade,,"Both India and the U.S. stand to gain by enhancing cooperation on trade

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's visit to India last week highlights the renewed focus in the U.S. on strengthening economic ties with Asia's third-largest economy and 'one of America's indispensable partners'. The current global environment with its macroeconomic, trade and strategic challenges makes it all the more compelling for the world's two largest democracies to deepen their engagement in a way that is mutually beneficial. In Delhi, Ms. Yellen emphasised that ""the United States and India share an interest in strengthening our supply chains in a world where certain governments wield trade as a geopolitical weapon"". The U.S. was particularly keen to minimise its vulnerability to supply-chain disruptions and was therefore pursuing a strategy of 'friendshoring', with India, a key element in the plan to cut its reliance on 'countries that present geopolitical and security risks' to the supply chain. Citing the Ukraine invasion and asserting that Moscow had 'weaponised' its supply of natural gas to Europe, as well as the challenges of China's dominance in the production of products such as solar panels, she underlined Washington's keenness to nurture local partners in developing countries to help mitigate over-concentration on select suppliers.

Ms. Yellen's visit also highlights the opportunities and challenges in the bilateral economic relationship, especially as the current dispensation in Washington moves to mend the ruptures caused by the Trump administration's antagonistic decisions on trade including the withdrawal of duty-free access to Indian exporters under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) as well as a 2020 decision to put India back on the U.S. Treasury's 'Monitoring List' over its currency practices. The U.S. is still to reinstate the GSP benefit and exporters on both sides still face challenges, notwithstanding the fact that the U.S. is one of India's largest trading partners. In fact, the International Trade Administration of the U.S. notes in its investment climate summary on India that ""new protectionist measures, including strict enforcement and potential expansion of data localisation measures, increased tariffs... and Indian-specific standards not aligned with international standards effectively closed off producers from global supply chains and restricted the expansion in bilateral trade and investment"". With India set to take up the reins of the G-20 presidency, New Delhi has a chance to steer the global economic and trade agenda towards greater equity, including on climate change, especially given Ms. Yellen's vocal assurance of U.S. backing. Both sides stand much to gain by enhancing mutual trust and cooperation, particularly on trade.",2022-11-14T19:05:00Z
The Times of India,IOC to recycle 20 million PET bottles annually for eco-friendly uniforms - Times of India,,"NEW DELHI: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the nation's largest oil firm, will recycle 20 million discarded mineral water, cold drink and other PET bottles annually to make eco-friendly uniforms for staff that man its petrol pumps and LPG distributor agencies, its chairman said.

In a glittering ceremony titled 'Unbottled - Towards a Greener Future', IOC Chairman SM Vaidya launched a special 'sustainable and green' uniform exclusively designed for nearly 3 lakh fuel station attendants and LPG gas delivery personnel of the company.

""There are 3.1 crore footfalls at our petrol stations every day. We deliver 27 lakh LPG cylinders per day and refuel 3,500 aircraft daily. Our tank trucks traverse 15 lakh kilometres a day. We are there everywhere,"" he said at the launch event.

IOC, which meets as much as half of the nation's fuel needs, has already committed to a net zero emission target by 2046 and is now venturing into recycling PET bottles, he added.

Empty PET packaging discarded by the consumer after use becomes PET waste. IOC will deploy an agency to collect such bottles - 20 million annually - and convert them into yarn to weave or knit fabric. This will then be supplied to a textile company for manufacturing uniforms for IOC's petrol pump attendants and LPG gas agency staff.

IOC is the first Indian firm to directly venture into the recycling of PET bottles.

The dress materials for these uniforms have been extracted from recycled polyester derived from the processing of used and discarded PET bottles. This initiative would support recycling about 405 tonnes of PET bottles, equivalent to offsetting over 20 million bottles yearly.

Bollywood actor and environmental activist Bhumi Pednekar lent her name to the initiative.

Vaidya said, ""These eco-friendly uniforms will shine as our green commitment, and I am delighted that our frontline energy soldiers will don them"".

""About 8 million metric tonnes of plastic enter the ocean annually, and about 150 million metric tonnes circulate in our marine ecosystems. At this pace, by 2050, there will be more plastics in the sea than fish. The conversion of plastic bottles into fabric is a beautiful example of how diligent handling of problems opens doors to new opportunities,"" he noted.

Vaidya also spoke of IOC's other eco-conservation outreaches like concerted drives to protect the Indian Single Horned Rhino and the reintroduction of Cheetahs in Indian forests after they went extinct over seven decades ago.

Bhumi Pednekar, while lauding IOC's green outreach, said, ""Each of us can play a significant role by embracing sustainability as the way of life. As a citizen of the country, I feel proud that the country's leading energy company is undertaking unique environmental efforts like these. My thanks and compliments to Indian Oil"".

A passionate advocate for the issue of climate change, Pednekar has also started a pan-India campaign Climate Warriors to raise awareness of environmental conservation and inspire citizens to embrace greener lifestyle choices.

Under this green initiative of IOC, used plastic bottles are shredded into flakes and then melted into micro-pellets. These micro-pellets are converted into yarns for weaving these green clothing.

The green impact of this fabric goes even beyond the recycling benefits. The clothes match virgin polyester in quality, but its manufacturing takes significantly fewer resources.

Its production requires almost 60 per cent less energy, and CO2 emissions are reduced by nearly one-third compared to virgin polyester. Even when these clothes wear out, the used Polycotton uniforms can be mechanically recycled and converted into low-end quilts, blankets or even high-end denim fabric. The fabric conforms to Global Recycling Standard Certification.",2022-11-13T06:54:00Z

The Times of India,Work On Bandhwari Waste Plant Likely To Start By December End: Ecogreen | Gurgaon News - Times of India,,"Gurgaon: Construction work on the waste-to-energy (WTE) plant, which was inaugurated by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar in December last year, will start by December 31 this year.

Representatives of waste management concessionaire Ecogreen have informed the nine-member committee constituted by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to look into the Bandhwari matter that the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract for the plant will be given to a private agency by December 15.

""Ecogreen has given assurances that work on the WTE will begin by December end. It is the best solution in the current scenario for waste processing. It requires minimum space and also produces energy. The traditional methods require more space and monitoring. We have seen several examples of WTE as a successful model to follow. We will keep a check so that the deadline now given by Ecogreen is adhered to,"" said Anil Mehta, MCG consultant (engineer) for the Swachh Bharat Mission.

MCG officials said Ecogreen is yet to complete the formalities related to environmental clearance and financial closure to set up the WTE plant at the site. The landfill site at Bandhwari has nearly 28 acres of land, out of which MCG has handed over 10 acres to Ecogreen for the plant.

When the foundation stone of the plant was laid on December 10 last year, MCG officials had said the 15 MW plant would generate six lakh units of electricity every day once operational.

Khattar had earlier laid the foundation stone of the plant on April 13, 2018. Ecogreen got environmental clearance for the 15 MW project from the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change in 2019.

The concessionaire, however, cited space constraints at Bandhwari and the Covid-19 pandemic as the reasons for delay in starting the work on the plant.

""We were waiting for the environmental clearance to install a 25 MW WTE plant. We haven't yet received that clearance, but we have the clearance for a 15 MW plant. The process for finalising the EPC contract is underway. We will start the work on the site by December end,"" said Sanjay Sharma, deputy CEO, Ecogreen.

A delegation of the MCG officials had in July this year visited the WTE plant in Sonipat. The delegation had concluded that MCG requires more land to set up a sanitary landfill and wet waste composting plant to make the WTE plant at Bandhwari successful. The Sonipat WTE plant is spread over 40 acres of land.",2022-10-12T06:19:00Z

The Times of India,"After draft development norms scrapped, GBA calls for new RP | Goa News - Times of India",,"Panaji: A day after town and country planning (TCP) minister Vishwajit Rane decided to scrap the draft building rules and all the cases under Section 16B of the TCP Act, Goa Bachao Abhiyan (GBA) called for commencement of work on a new regional plan at the earliest.

GBA also welcomed the decision of the TCP minister to scrap the controversial amendments to the TCP Act and all the cases under 16B conceding to public demand.

""GBA awaits the oral pronouncements to translate into the requisite legal notifications. Section 16B, which is primarily responsible for large illegalities, should be addressed once and for all,"" GBA stated.

The GBA has called for separation of development control rules that were merged with building by-laws, which had resulted in unacceptable proposals in the plan and hence the amendments had to be scrapped. ""While the TCP minister indicated that he would talk to the MLAs on the subject, he is yet to respond to our request for a meeting to give a presentation on the impact of the amendments and suggestions for planning keeping the interest of Goa in the changing scenario of climate change and sustainable development,"" general secretary Reboni Saha said.

""At the outset the legal provisions have to be made to ensure that people's participation at the panchayatand/municipal level takes place as per the 73rd and 74th amendments.

The Times of India,Andhra Pradesh: Tigers number on rise in Nagarjuna Sagar Srisailam Tiger Reserve | Visakhapatnam News - Times of India,,"VISAKHAPATNAM: 'Their survival is in our hands' - the slogan has been implemented in a well-protected manner by the Andhra Pradesh government with the needed measures for tiger protection. With these measures, the tiger population in the state has witnessed steady growth, and now it is above 60 from 48 four-years-ago in the country's largest Tiger Reserve Nagarjuna Sagar Srisailam Tiger Reserve (NSTR).

Apart from the scientific methods of monitoring Tigers, the state put a strong protection network in place to protect the big cats. With these efforts, the forest authorities are expecting around 70 big cats in the NSTR in the recent census. The census details would be revealed on Global Tiger Day or World Tiger day by the central government on Friday.

AP (48) stood on 12th place among the states having the highest number of tigers while Telangana (26) on 16th place in the last census, 2018.

NSTR was created in the year 1982-83, with three wildlife life divisions and it is now in an extent of 3,727 sq km in three undivided districts Kurnool, Prakasam, and Guntur. It is the largest tiger reserve in the country even after the bifurcation of the state.

The state government is now focussing to encourage wildlife eco-tourism in the NSTR area, not in the core area. So that people will know the importance of the wildlife and conditions prevailing in the area to get awareness. The government would announce its plans in a month or two, sources said.

The Principal Chief Conservator of Forest and Head of Forest Forces (PCCF and HoFF) Y Madhusudan Reddy told TOI that healthy growth in the population of tigers was noticed in the NSTR.

""With huge support from the local community, engaged in high protection by helpers and no-poaching cases in the area, besides no man and animal conflict, there has been a steady growth in the numbers,"" the 1990 batch IFS officer said.

He added that people should also know the importance of the conservation of tigers and wild animals. If they visit the areas, then they would be aware of the issue and demand for conservation of wild animals by joining hands with the forest department, he said.

The government should encourage eco-tourism in the areas of NSTR including Atmakuru, Markapuram, Giddalur, Nandyal, Srisailam, Nagarjuna Sagar, and Dornala. So that people should know the importance of protection of tigers and other animals, an NGO activist G Srinivas said.

He further said that the number of pilgrims is high in the Srisailam area but there is a need to encourage eco-tourism in the same area by providing facilities.

The government declared the tiger India's national animal, banned hunting, and set up a conservation scheme called Project Tiger. There are 53 reserves today under the program, and about half are well managed, according to a government assessment. Project Tiger has helped a lot in increasing the number of tigers in India.

Initially, only nine tiger reserves were covered under project tiger and now increased to 53. There were only 1411 tigers in 2006 and 1706 in 2011. The number reached 2,226 in 2014 and 2,967 are in India by the 2018 census. The number is expected to cross 3000 by the 2022 census.

The wildlife deputy conservator of forest G Naga Malleswari said that the reasons behind the decrease in the tiger population were poaching and illegal trade, habitat loss due to human activities, deforestation, climate changes, and others. The AP Forest department successfully addressed the issues of poaching with the help of the local community helpers., she said.",2022-07-28T14:48:00Z
The Times of India,Drought Fear Looms Over State Farmers | Ranchi News - Times of India,,"Daltonganj: An associate director (zonal research centre) of the Birsa Agriculture University (BAU), D N Singh, feared that farmers may resort to distress sale of their goat or cattle to tide over fiscal stress in the wake of scanty rain this monsoon, triggering fears of drought in Palamu.

Singh said, ""Goats are like the ATM cards or instant cash for the poor farmers, who are facing drought-like situation. A poor farmer relies on his goats for food or to meet expenses incurred during treatment for any sick person in the family. Those who do not rear goats have cows and oxen. There is a strong fear of distress sale of livestock if the situation does not improve.""

Singh linked the situation to global warming and climate change. ""There is a paradigm shift in the pattern of rainfall here over past 10 years. June and July didn't have good rain,"" he said.",2022-07-21T03:02:00Z

This was stated by deputy director of PTR's south division, Mukesh Kumar.

The relocation of villages from PTR's core habitat has been a long pending work mandated by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA).

The relocated family will become the owners of the 'khatyani' land and have the right to live for generations or sell it whenever they want.

PTR field director Kumar Ashutosh said the proposal for relocation is awaiting clearance from the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change. ""The residents of Latu and Kujrum villages are willing to move out voluntarily,"" he added.

Mukesh said, ""The poor inhabitants of Latu and Kujrum villages are a picture of denial as many governmental schemes cannot reach them unless they are relocated."" Living in the jungle, that too in tiger reserve territory, has its own hazards, he added.

Hindustan Times,India slams rich nations over resource inequity,,"India criticised the World Trade Organization (WTO), particularly rich countries, accusing them of not doing enough to tackle the crises brought on by the pandemic and rising food prices, which put millions of people in poor nations at the risk of starvation

India criticised the World Trade Organization (WTO), particularly rich countries, accusing them of not doing enough to tackle the crises brought on by the pandemic and rising food prices, which put millions of people in poor nations at the risk of starvation.

Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal made the remark while representing India at the plenary session of the Twelfth Ministerial Conference (MC12) of the WTO on Sunday, where he urged members to help the least developed countries (LDCs) recover from the pandemic and access foodgrain supplies that have undergone high global inflation because of the war in Ukraine.

""The pandemic reinforced the importance of 'One Earth One Health', calling for global solidarity and collective action,"" he said, referring to India's effort in ramping up supplies of medical products globally and providing Covid-essential items, including vaccines, to several countries.

""Unfortunately, the WTO could not respond with alacrity. We have let down the people of the LDCs and developing countries. The rich countries need to introspect! We need to bow our heads in shame for our inability to respond to the pandemic in time,"" he said in his address.

Goyal drew attention of the multilateral forum to the humanitarian crisis triggered by spiralling food inflation and called it a ""matter of deep concern"", while also underscoring the importance of nurturing domestic capacities to produce food. ""Rising food prices threaten the survival of millions and subjugate the poor and vulnerable nations/people to imperfect markets,"" he said.

India, which is supporting its 800 million poor through food security programmes such as the ₹3.4-crore scheme under the Prime Minister Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana (PMGKAY), reiterated the need to have public procurement of foodstocks by offering minimum support price (MSP) to farmers.

""After the Bali Ministerial Decision in 2013, the General Council in 2014 mandated permanent solution on the issue of public foodstocks, which has already been delayed, should be the topmost priority for MC12, before we move to new areas. Nothing is more important than this for the people of the world,"" he said.

The public foodstocks issue stems from the WTO's restrictions on subsidies the government can provide, a restriction that was meant to ensure markets remain competitive globally. But economic inequities have complicated this arrangement, especially for developing countries.

""Our collective moral obligation is to ensure that no person, anywhere in the world, goes to bed hungry and WTO rules should facilitate this. The Covid-19 pandemic has reinforced once again the need and efficacy of food stockholding for public good,"" he said.

India's stand on this matter is backed by the G33, a group of 47 developing and least developed countries. Separately, addressing the G33, Goyal urged them to work collectively to get a fair, balanced and development-centric outcome at the WTO that must also include a permanent solution for the public stockholding.

According to current WTO rules, a member country's food subsidy is capped at a ceiling of 10% of the value of production based on 1986-88 prices. The cap can be exceeded in certain circumstances under a peace clause.

Last year, India invoked the peace clause for the third time for rice procurement exceeding the 10% ceiling on the subsidy it offered to its farmers, which is critical for the country's food security.

India's stand has been that public stockpiling is critical for its food security and total subsidies given by the US and the European Union nations far exceed those offered by India, based on India's updated calculations.

India and other like-minded countries now want a permanent solution to this matter. The 'peace clause' was adopted at the Ninth Ministerial held in Bali in December 2013 as an ""interim solution"" to avoid raising disputes under various provisions on WTO Agreement on Agriculture (AoA) with respect to public stockholding (PSH).

India sought differential treatment between developed and developing countries on fishing. ""Fishing by my country's traditional fishermen and women is to address hunger, poverty, food and nutrition insecurity, which is largely sustenance fishing. Their right to life and livelihood cannot be curtailed in any manner. On the contrary, those nations responsible for depleted fish-stock should assume responsibility, having exploited the oceans for far too long by giving subsidies,"" he said, adding that living in harmony with nature is enshrined in Indian culture and its fishing communities customarily do not fish during the breeding season to allow stocks to be replenished, thereby maintaining the aquatic ecological balance.

The WTO should embrace a people-first approach to trade, Goyal said. ""...let me say that when the world is facing severe challenges and expects the WTO to deliver solutions, the MC12 must send a strong message that the rich care for the poor, vulnerable and marginalised people and that we have come together to give them a better future,"" he said.

WTO reform is necessary keeping development at its core, to be decided through a precise, transparent and inclusive process, upholding the basic principles and objectives of the WTO, particularly consensus-based decision making and special and differential treatment (S&DT).

S&DT permits developing countries certain concessions as compared to the developed world, because of historical reasons.

""India strongly believes that the WTO should not negotiate rules on non-trade-related subjects like climate change, gender, etc. which legitimately fall within the domain of other inter-governmental organisations,"" Goyal said.

Goyal, however, said India is committed for environment protection. ""India reiterates our Prime Minister's clarion call for sustainable living through 'Lifestyle For Environment (LiFE)', a movement aimed at promoting environment-conscious lifestyle, focusing on 'mindful and deliberate utilisation' instead of 'mindless and destructive consumption'. He quoted Mahatma Gandhi to make the point: ""The world has enough for everyone's needs, but not for everyone's greed.""",2022-06-12T19:39:00Z
The Times of India,Tamil Nadu: Anbumani Ramadoss vows to change casteist image of Paattali Makkal Katchi | Chennai News - Times of India,,"CHENNAI: PMK 2. 0agenda is to change the casteist image of the party and demonstrate before the people that it is here to do good for the people of Tamil Nadu. The PMK would do developmental politics, said Anbumani Ramadoss, the new party chief on Saturday.

Addressing the party special general body meeting in the city, he claimed the PMK had all the requisite qualities to govern the state.

It had successfully thwarted laying of the natural gas pipeline through agricultural fields in western Tamil Nadu and monorail project in Chennai. It forced the state to introduce a separate budget for agriculture. He took credit for introduction of 'samacheer kalvi' in the state, brining 108 communities under the MBC category and getting 10. 5% internal reservation for Vanniars among others.

""The list of achievements is very long and we have to make the people of Tamil Nadu realise it and accept us,'' he said, adding that the file on total prohibition would be the first one he would sign if he assumes office as the chief minister.

He said that when he became the youngest cabinet minister of India in 2004, his father had advised him that he should practice corruption-free politics and ensure that even common man gets medical attention on a par with the President of India.

The PMK is the only party which campaigns against climate change and its consequences. He said Tamil Nadu's comparison should be with Singapore and not with a backward state like Bihar.

He said every party in the state was doing divisive politics in the name of caste and creed. The PMK, on the contrary, was keen on ushering in social justice and development for all, he claimed. Senior Ramadoss said he was standing before the crowd as a proud father and urged the cadres to work towards making his son the chief minister of the state. His advice to the cadres was that they should not waste time by indulging in petty politics and craving for party posts.

""When we first contested the assembly elections alone in 1996, the PMK won four seats. Now, 25 years later, we have just five seats. Who is responsible for this miserable performance?'' he asked, pointing out that Aam Aadmi, formed in 2012, had won Delhi and Punjab assembly elections. Anbumani's elevation as party chief would bring about the desired changes within the party, he said. ""Our goal is 2026 (assembly elections),"" said Ramadoss.",2022-05-29T02:19:00Z
The Hindu,Prepare shore management plan for erosion-hit Kerala coast: KSSP,,"The Kerala Sastra Sahitya Parishad (KSSP) has urged the State government to urgently prepare a comprehensive 'Shore Management Plan' for protecting the erosion-ravaged Kerala coast through eco-friendly solutions.

The KSSP, at a two-day district conference, passed a resolution demanding the government to avoid use of 'hard structures' like seawalls and groynes for coastal protection and, instead, opt for 'soft solutions' like beach nourishment and offshore submerged reefs.

The resolution noted that the National Green Tribunal, in an April 11 order, had urged coastal states to prepare shore management plans and favour softer options over hard structures.

Environment-friendly solutions should be employed urgently to revive the vanished beaches in Thiruvananthapuram district, especially Shangumughom where the construction of a diaphragm wall had upset the equilibrium of the coast and opened up the possibility of erosion to its north, the resolution said.

The fishery harbours at Vizhinjam and Muthalappozhi, and the more recent development of the Vizhinjam international seaport, have aggravated coastal erosion in Thiruvananthapuram district. These man-made structures have upset the natural processes of the coast, hindering the movement of coastal sand and its accretion.

This manmade situation is further aggravated by the climate change and the rise of sea water levels. ''It can be said without a doubt that the Thiruvananthapuram coast is experiencing a man-made disaster,'' the resolution said.

Decades ago, sandy beaches lined the 78-km coastline of Thiruvananthapuram district. Today, about 25 kilometres have been transformed into seawall-lined coast, sans beaches. Thickly-populated places like Kollengode, Pozhiyoor, Panathura, Poonthura, Beemapally, Valiyathura, Kochuthope, Shangumughom, Thazhampally and Anchuthengu have lost their beaches, leaving them vulnerable to the onslaught of waves, the KSSP noted.",2022-05-22T12:57:00Z
Hindustan Times,"In new roadmap for India-EU trade deal, 2024 is the deadline to conclude talks",,"NEW DELHI: India and the European Union (EU) are looking to conclude negotiations on comprehensive trade and investment agreements before the beginning of electoral cycles on both sides in 2024, EU ambassador Ugo Astuto said on Friday.

As the two sides broaden and deepen their economic cooperation, the European Investment Bank (EIB), which is the lending arm of the EU, intends to double its annual investments in India from the current level of about €500 million in the next two years.

The Indian and EU leadership decided last year to resume negotiations on a free trade agreement (FTA), which had stalled in 2013, and to launch talks on agreements on investments and geographical indications. The two sides agreed on a framework for these talks when commerce secretary BVR Subrahmanyam visited Brussels earlier this month.

Astuto said the two sides have agreed on parameters and a roadmap for negotiations on a trade deal. ""The first round of talks will be held in June and we hope to have a couple of round of talks before the end of the year,"" he told a small group of reporters.

The two sides are hoping to conclude the negotiations before the start of the next electoral cycle for India and the EU in 2024, Astuto said. He set aside speculation that the two sides could have an interim trade deal before finalising a full-fledged agreement, saying: ""Both sides are aiming at a broad, comprehensive and ambitious FTA.""

India is slated to have its next general election in 2024, while the first elections to the European Parliament following Britain's exit from the EU will be held the same year. India is also negotiating an FTA with the UK and both sides have set a target of concluding the talks by October.

The proposed trade deal also figured in European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen's recent engagements with the Indian leadership in New Delhi.

EIB vice president Christian Kettel Thomsen said the EU's investment bank plans to double its annual investments in India from the current level of about €500 million within the next two years. He said this target is ""doable"" and dovetails with the EU's ambitions related to the trade deal with India.

With the EU's current focus on green energy to reduce Europe's dependence on Russian oil and gas, EIB will also focus on green and sustainable projects in India, officials of the bank said. EIB's annual investments total €60 billion and half of this amount is targeted toward climate mitigation.

Many of EIB's initiatives are aligned with EU's new Global Gateway initiative launched last year to boost smart, clean and secure links in the digital, energy and transport sectors. Global Gateway plans to mobilise €300 billion in investments between 2021 and 2027.

In India, EIB has invested €3.1 billion in the metro projects in Agra, Bengaluru, Bhopal, Kanpur, Lucknow and Pune. This includes €650 million for the Kanpur metro project, the bank's second-largest loan outside the EU. EIB has accepted an invitation to join the India-led Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) and is also looking to work with the International Solar Alliance on projects in Africa.",2022-04-29T13:17:00Z
The Times of India,birsac:  Birsac To Get A Modern Lab | Patna News - Times of India,,"PATNA: The department of science and technology (DST) has begun work on modernising Bihar Remote Sensing Application Centre (BIRSAC) in order to boost its efficiency.

The centre provides a time-efficient and cost-effective method of assessment for planning the state's development activities.

The BIRSAC will receive a modern laboratory as part of the upgrade, which will include 11 high-end workstations, a primary and backup server, and software and hardware for scientists to work, research, and plan in a variety of fields. The project is estimated to cost around Rs 6 crore.

DST secretary Lokesh Kumar Singh told TOI that by incorporating cutting-edge technology, the centre's technical capacity would improve its suitability for conducting research on development projects and provide training and apprenticeship to students of ITIs.

The modernisation of BIRSAC will enable it to provide information to the relevant state departments on a variety of projects. It entails forecasting agricultural output using space-based agrometeorological and land-based observations, horticulture assessment and management using geoinformatics, project inventory of forest/tree cover, inventory of fisheries resources using high-resolution imageries of the entire state of Bihar, integrated watershed management project for monitoring and evaluation, space-based information support for decentralised planning, and surveillance of stubble burning.

BIRSAC was established under the auspices of the Bihar Council on Science and Technology (BCST) to leverage new satellite technology to provide necessary inputs to various departments or organizations during the planning process.

BCST officials stated that because the centre's hardware and software were nearly 10 years old, they must be upgraded to accommodate the state's expansion of activities.

""The process of procuring the latest hardware and software has already begun. Additionally, the development of a state-of-the-art BIRSAC laboratory is underway and will be completed shortly. The modern laboratory will assist various departments such as agriculture, environment, forest and climate change, water resources, and urban development and housing in developing and implementing their policies,"" they added.",2022-03-10T07:14:00Z
The Times of India,Most lives lost to lightning in 2021: IMD chief | India News - Times of India,,"ALWAR (Rajasthan): There has been a marked increase in lightning and thunderstorms in the year 2021 and they have become deadlier too.

Sharing the details of casualties arising out of extreme weather events in 2021, director general of India Meteorological Department (IMD), Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, said out of 1,750 deaths occurring due to different extreme weather events, lightning accounted for 45% casualties corresponding to 787, far above than the casualties caused by cyclonic storms (172), which is otherwise considered more dreadful.

Deaths due to flood, heavy rain and landslide accounted for 43% (759) casualties. Lightning events causing deaths have mostly been reported from the eastern part of the country -- Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh.

Mohapatra was addressing journalists in a symposium organised by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) on the topic Code Red on Climate: What Science Is Telling Us, here on Wednesday. ""Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Odisha have been the worst-hit states in terms of casualties due to extreme weather events,"" he said. Jharkhand, which has remained a thunder hotspot for several years, had all the casualties due to extreme weather events linked to lightning while Bihar, Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal had the biggest chunk of casualties linked to lightning.

Akshit Sangomla of CSE said lightning and thunderstorm-related events are among the most under-reported category of extreme weather events. Throwing light on the possible reasons for increasing extreme weather events, particularly lightning and sudden rainfall, climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, Roxy Mathew Koll, linked it to marine heat wave. Koll, who has been pioneering research in marine heatwaves, said though the field in terms of research is new, it had huge potential to impact extreme weather events. ""Marie heatwaves are a known phenomena of the Bay of Bengal but this year, western Indian Ocean experienced four-fold and northern Bay of Bengal two-three fold rise in numer of marine heatwaves,"" he said. Koll linked marine heatwaves to sudden rise in moisture-laden warm winds which often results in heavy rainfall and thunder. ""Chances are there that the marine heatwaves have triggered thunder close to Bay of Bengal and neighouring Bengal, Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand and MP,"" he said.

The marine heatwaves, most of which is recorded through satellite imagery, have pointed that the average sea surface temperature, which is around 27-28 degrees Celsius, have often touched 30-31 degrees Celsius. ""One buoy deployed at the Bay of Bengal captured temperature as high as 34 degrees Celsius, indicating that the oceans are acting as the heat sink of global warming and eventually resulting in extreme weather conditions in the coastal regions and neighbourhood,"" Koll said. IMD also pointed to other anomalies in weather events recorded last year. Mohapatra said 2021 was the 5th warmest year on record since 1901. ""The mean annual average temperature increased by 0.44 degrees Celsius and we have noticed that the mean temperature in most parts of the country has increased,"" he said, adding that the anomalies could be directly linked to climate change.",2022-03-03T14:39:00Z

Steered jointly by the Department of Science and Technology (DST) and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), NSM is implemented by C-DAC and IISc. The Mission has supported the deployment of 10 supercomputer systems so far at IISc, IITs, IISER Pune, JNCASR, NABI-Mohali and C-DAC, with a cumulative computing power of 17 petaflops.

IISc added that about 31 lakh computational jobs have successfully been carried out by around 2,600 researchers across the country to date. These systems, it said, have greatly helped faculty members and students carry out major R&D activities, including developing platforms for genomics and drug discovery, studying urban environmental issues, establishing flood warning and prediction systems, and optimising telecom networks.

""The Param Pravega system at IISc is a mix of heterogeneous nodes, with Intel Xeon Cascade Lake processors for the CPU nodes and NVIDIA Tesla V100 cards on the GPU nodes. The hardware consists of an ATOS BullSequana XH2000 series system, with a comprehensive peak compute power of 3.3 petaflops. The software stack on top of the hardware is provided and supported by C-DAC. The machine hosts an array of program development tools, utilities, and libraries for developing and executing High Performance Computing (HPC) applications,"" IISc added.

The institute already has a cutting-edge supercomputing facility established several years ago. In 2015, it procured and installed SahasraT, which was at that time the fastest supercomputer in the country.

""Faculty members and students have been using this facility to carry out research in various impactful and socially-relevant areas. These include research on Covid-19 and other infectious diseases, such as modelling viral entry and binding, studying interactions of proteins in bacterial and viral diseases, and designing new molecules with antibacterial and antiviral properties,"" the statement read.

Researchers, IISc said, have also used the facility to simulate turbulent flows for green energy technologies, study climate change and associated impacts, analyse aircraft engines and hypersonic flight vehicles, and many other research activities. ""...These efforts are expected to ramp up significantly with Param Pravega,"" IISc said.",2022-02-03T08:17:00Z
Hindustan Times,Vande Bharat in union budget: Opposition asks Kerala govt to drop Silverline,,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The announcement of 400 high- speed Vande Bharat trains in the union budget has kicked up a fresh debate in Kerala as many critics of the proposed Silverline said it is a good alternative and asked the state government to drop the project, but the latter said both are different and it will go ahead with its plan.

The critics say while Silverline trains can run at a speed of 200 km per hour, Vande Bharat trains can take a speed of 180-200 kmph and it can be a good alternative and prevent mass displacement of people and check high expenditure. Besides environmental activists, opposition Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also said it is a good alternative. But K Rail managing director V Ajith Kumar said both are different and the government will go ahead with its plan.

""Both Silverline and Vanda Bharat trains will run at the same speed and railways will bear expenses of the new trains. It is high time the state should reconsider its project which will leave environmental degradation and mass displacement,"" said opposition leader V D Satheesan.

Senior Congress leader and Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor, who earlier courted a controversy for not toeing the party line on Silverline project, said it can be a good alternative and the state government should study it in detail. ""If Kerala gets a good numbers of these trains, it will meet the demand put up by the state government for a speedy transport line and also a solution to concerns raised by the opposition about financial burden and environmental issues arising out of the project,"" he tweeted.

BJP state president K Surendran also asked the government to drop the project. ""Both will have same speed then why do you want to displace so many people,"" he asked. But, former finance minister Thomas Issac said both are different and the state needed both. ""Some people are mixing both deliberately, but they are different. Silverline will be an engine of growth for the state,"" he said.

The state government's ambitious high speed rail project ran into trouble after main opposition parties and green activists opposed it vehemently. The ₹63,940 crore project seeks to develop a high-speed rail corridor connecting Kasaragod in the state's north to Thiruvananthapuram in the south. The state needs 1,383 hectares of land for the proposed project, of which 1198 hectares are private.

The rail line will bring down the travel time between Kasaragod and Thiruvananthapuram, covering 529.45 km, from 12 hours to four hours. It will be completed by 2025, said Kerala Rail Development Corporation Ltd (KRDCL), the nodal agency for the project. But the union government is yet to approve the project and no social and environmental impact studies have been held so far.

Besides the opposition, many green activists also opposed the big budget project saying it will be a disaster for the state. They said the government conceived the idea when climate experts and others warned it will face recurring calamities due to climate change.

Last month, noted social activist Medha Patakar also joined the protest against the project and said she never expected such a project from a Left government. ""High-speed Vande Bharat trains are a good alternative and the government should dump the Silverline project which will invite untold miseries to people,"" said environmental activist C R Neelakandan.",2022-02-02T15:34:00Z
Hindustan Times,"Deliberate weaponisation of pathogens big concern, need to develop bio-defence: NSA Ajit Doval",,"Pune: National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval on Thursday called for the need to build comprehensive national capabilities and bio-defence, bio-safety, and bio-security, saying that ""deliberate weaponisation of dangerous pathogens"" was a matter of serious concern.

Doval was speaking on 'National security preparedness in the age of disasters and pandemics', at the Pune Dialogue on National Security (PDNS) 2021 organised by Pune International Centre. ""The deliberate weaponisation of dangerous pathogens is a serious concern. This has heightened the need to build comprehensive national capabilities and bio-defence, bio-safety, and bio-security,"" he said.

The NSA also said that the Covid-19 pandemic has reinforced the need to predict threats and while biological research has legitimate scientific purposes, its dual-use application can be misused.

Doval said new areas of warfare have shifted from territorial frontiers to civil societies, adding that factors like people's health, their sense of wellbeing and security, and their perception of government impact the will of a nation.

Pointing at the changes taking place in global security landscape, he said, ""Wars are increasingly becoming cost-ineffective instruments of achieving the nation's political and military objectives. The new areas of warfare have shifted from merely territorial frontiers to the civil societies. The common people's thinking, health, sense of well-being and their perception of their government have assumed new importance.""

All these elements, Doval said, cumulatively impact the will of the nation.

Protecting people from false and motivated propaganda also becomes ""absolutely necessary"" in the age of information revolution, the NSA said. National security planning needs to factor in all these challenges and strategies to maximum international cooperation, he added.

""The Covid-19 pandemic and devastating natural disasters have the potential to impact the collective psyche of the people, their economic well-being, and instill fears about their survival,"" the NSA said during the virtual address.

""It generates social imbalance that can threaten the political stability, economic growth, and even the capacity of a nation to resolutely meet its external and internal threats,"" he added.

These new genres of security threats present multi-level dilemma on a massive scale, Doval said. ""At the micro-level, they include saving individual lives, providing medical care and supporting people, ensuring the supplies of food and essential commodities, and maintaining law and order,"" he added.

The issues include finding effective preventive and curative medicines and administering them to combat the ever-evolving new strains of viruses, and ensuring smooth supply chains, he said.

Expressing concern over the climate change as another ""threat"" that multiplies with unpredictable consequences, Doval said: ""It impacts the availability of resources, which are increasingly becoming scarce and could become a source of conflict than the competition. Climate change can accelerate instability and cause massive population displacement.""",2021-10-28T18:05:00Z
Hindustan Times,"Delhi's annual air quality index worsens, to worsen next week",,"Delhi's air quality index (AQI) reading, jumped from 127 on Thursday to 167 on Friday, and then to 171 on Saturday

With the withdrawal of monsoon from Delhi -- and other parts of northwest India -- on Friday, the Capital's recent run of clear, clean, cerulean skies has started to give way to an annual veil of smog borne largely by stubble fires in neighbouring states. Data from the central pollution watchdog shows that the city's air quality has seen a gradual, but sustained, drop over the past 10 days. And as farm fires pick up in Haryana and Punjab, Delhi's air is only likely to get worse over the coming week.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Friday declared the withdrawal of the south-west monsoon from Delhi, which means that the moisture-laden easterly winds blowing over the Capital have now been replaced with dry, north-westerly winds. These winds will bring down temperatures, but push pollution levels, said weather forecasters.

Recordings by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) show that as the wind patterns changed on Friday, air quality levels fell sharply.

Delhi's air quality index (AQI) reading, jumped from 127 on Thursday to 167 on Friday, and then to 171 on Saturday.

An AQI between zero and 50 is considered 'good', 51 and 100 'satisfactory', 101 and 200 'moderate', 201 and 300 'poor', 301 and 400 'very poor', and 401 and 500 'severe'.

Experts said that this is the impact of stubble fires in the neighbouring agrarian states of Punjab and Haryana.

Scientists from the United States's National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) said that the rise in farm stubble burning is visible in the increased number of ""fire dots"" spotted over the region on satellite imagery.

""Over the last one week, as the clouds have cleared up, there is a consistent increase in the number of fires appearing over north India. This will start impacting the region's air quality,"" said Pawan Gupta, a research scientist at the Goddard Earth Sciences Technology and Research (GESTAR), Universities Space Research Association.

NASA's fire map on Saturday showed a jump in fires over parts of Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Tarn Taran, Ludhiana, Shahid Bhagat Singh Nagar and Sangrur in Punjab. In Haryana, fires were observed in parts of Kaithal, Kurukshetra, Ambala, Yamuna Nagar, Karnal and Panipat.

Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also warned Delhiites of the impending deterioration of the city's air quality in a series of tweets on Friday and Saturday.

Kejriwal has tweeted out the city's daily air quality for the past month to establish that the AQI in the city, with only local pollution sources at play is in the ""acceptable"" range, but as soon as farmers in the neighbouring states start setting their fields on fire, the air quality in Delhi starts taking a nosedive.

""Pollution has started increasing. 09 Oct-AQI - 171...,"" Kejriwal tweeted on Saturday.

Weather forecasters warned that from October 15, temperatures will start falling, which will increase the share of stubble smoke in the city's air.

""At present, Delhi is largely getting north-westerly winds with some components of westerly winds, but there is a forecast of day and night temperatures falling from October 15, which will lead to the formation of haze because of the stubble fire smoke. The air quality is likely to get bad from here on,"" said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change) at Skymet Weather Services.

Union Ministry of Earth Science's air quality monitoring system, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar), also forecasted the impending worsening of air quality in Delhi. They also highlighted that the primary pollutants in the city's air on Friday were ""fire emissions and dust suspensions"".",2021-10-09T18:19:00Z
Hindustan Times,Imagining a climate-resilient economy,,"Should India commit to eliminating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by a certain date in future (net zero)? This is an important but a partial question

Should India commit to eliminating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by a certain date in future (net zero)? This is an important but a partial question. The question we should be asking is: How can India's climate policy help transform the economy to be more resilient and competitive in a climate changed world?

It is not the pressure of international negotiations but the imperative of economic transformation that matters more for India. Will India make steel in 2050? Yes. Will steel manufacturing look the same then as now? Very unlikely. Will India make cars in 2040? Yes. Will it be able to export petrol cars then? Almost certainly not. Will India face carbon-related trade barriers in 2030? Very possible. Every major economic sector now faces a choice: Pursue brown growth and short-term competitiveness, or low-carbon growth, green jobs and long-term resilience?

India must build its international climate narrative against that core objective and around four themes: Planetary impact; equitable differentiation; upgraded nationally determined contributions (NDCs); and contingent commitments.

First, rather than be defensive, India should speak for the planet. What matters is atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs). CO2, once emitted, stays in the atmosphere for a long time, so historical and future emissions matter.

Also Read | India won't raise its climate ambition at the behest of developed nations: Javadekar

In 2007, India pledged that its per capita emissions would never exceed that of developed countries. As a genuine custodian of the planet, India should now commit that its per capita as well as its cumulative emissions (1901-2100) would never exceed that of China, the European Union or the United States. In fact, if India's emissions peak in 2040 and the country aims for net zero emissions by 2070, then even its future emissions would be lower than that of China or the US. This is why it is critical that India adopts a peaking year as well as set the direction of travel towards net zero.

Second, India should demand that developed countries advance their net zero commitments. Leaving aside economies in transition (post-Soviet countries), which witnessed a drop in emissions thanks to economic collapse, developed countries reduced emissions by only 1.6% during 1990-2018. The record of the past 30 years offers little by way of confidence in their promises for the next 30 years.

Whereas the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change argues that the world should aim for net zero emissions by 2050, the same cannot apply to all countries. No race is won by all participants reaching the finishing line at the same time. Climate justice would dictate that the largest cumulative emitters achieve net zero before 2050, giving smaller and poorer developing countries additional years of carbon space to aim for net zero after 2050. This approach would also put a premium on near-term actions in developed countries.

Third, India should translate its domestic pronouncements into policy and its domestic policies into upgraded NDC submitted to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. In September 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi first talked about India aiming for 450 gigawatts of renewable energy. Later, the target year was set as 2030. However, this target is not enshrined in law or policy. Similarly, there have been announcements that 30% of vehicles sold in 2030 would be electric. While laudable, there is no policy to back this up.

Such ambitions must be enshrined in policy to send credible signals to the market. Moreover, India should translate these targets into emissions intensity reduction commitments. If India managed 450GW of renewables by 2030, it would mean 54% reduction in emissions intensity against 2005 levels (far above the 33-35% reduction India has promised).

Fourth, India should propose contingent commitments, wherein its target year for net zero emissions would be contingent on technological progress and availability of investment. A recent analysis from CEEW showed that for India to peak emissions in 2030 and achieve net zero emissions by 2050 would be unprecedented. Developed countries are giving themselves more than 40 years, and up to 77 years, for their transition.

India should not declare 2050 as net zero but a year in the future. But it should make the commitment contingent, which would give certainty (for net zero), credibility (by declaring a peaking year sooner than later) and flexibility (by reviewing and revising decisions based on market developments).

India needs hundreds of billions of dollars for investment in renewables, e-mobility, industrial energy efficiency and shutting down dirtier power plants. These investments would have net benefits in terms of avoided costs of pollution and damages from climate crisis. But available capital is insufficient and expensive. India should propose a green finance platform to deepen financial markets at home but demand that public money be used to de-risk international institutional investment.

Equally, India must stop waiting for technology handouts and instead co-develop disruptive technologies such as green hydrogen, advanced biofuels and carbon capture and sequestration. Significant R&D investment will be needed. India should propose multi-country tech development platforms with targeted goals for price reduction and deployment at scale.

Our approach to climate negotiations should create opportunities for an economic transformation, not just an energy transition. For sustainability to shift from the margins of environmental negotiations to the mainstream of political discourse, we must reimagine our economy of the future.",2021-04-14T10:36:00Z
Hindustan Times,Mumbai slums are 6 degrees Celsius warmer than neighbouring housing societies in October: Study - mumbai news - Hindustan Times,,"WRI India published three satellite maps -October Heat series - highlighting location-specific risk exposure to citizens

The city's slum settlements are five-six degrees warmer than their neighbouring housing societies, while 37% of Mumbai's households with metal roof structures are exposed to a risk of high rise in temperatures or heat risk post monsoon, a study by the geo-analytics team of environment group World Resource Institute (WRI) India across the city during October over the past three years has revealed. The study found the city has an alarming shortage of green cover.

WRI India published three satellite maps -October Heat series - highlighting location-specific risk exposure to citizens. The maps established microclimatic changes and temperature variation within Mumbai, and called for city-specific policies that need to build on by adopting more nature-based solutions to adapt to climate risks.

""Coastal cities do not record very high air temperatures, but the combination of temperature and humidity (heat index) is significantly high, especially for humid months like October, making it high risk for those most exposed. Prolonged exposure can lead to exhaustion and serious health ailments,"" said Lubaina Rangwala, senior manager (urban development and resilience), WRI India, adding that October was one of the most severe weather months for Mumbai.

""As the rains retreat, there is high moisture availability combined with a rise in temperature. While the absolute temperatures may not be very high, 90% humidity combined with low wind speed allows the heat index and stress to shoot up in Mumbai. This is why we chose October.""

The first map showed slums in Dharavi recorded 35.9 degrees Celsius (during October over three years), while housing societies in Matunga recorded 30.3 degrees Celsius. A similar phenomenon was recorded across Powai-Vikhroli, Goregaon, and Girgaum-Marine Lines.

""We found that this was a function of the type of building material used, compromised ventilation and green cover, and limited access to open spaces,"" said Rangwala.

The analysis revealed that industrial and commercial land use with large built-up footprints such as the airport, industrial estates and malls had a significantly higher surface temperature (33-35 degrees Celsius) than natural areas - forests, lakes, mangroves (27-32 degrees Celsius).

The second map showed the difference in surface temperatures of settlements using concrete versus metal roofs. ""Roofs are the most exposed surfaces of a building to solar radiation, and play a key role in determining indoor thermal comfort. Metal roofs are poor insulators and good conductors, resulting in increased indoor temperatures, while concrete transfers heat at a slower rate, resulting in increased night-time temperatures,"" said Rangwala.

The ward-wise breakup of roofing material showed S ward (Bhandup, Powai, Kanjurmarg, Vikhroli and Nahur) had the highest share of metal or asbestos roofing material (57%), followed by P-North ward (Malad, Manori, Marve, Aksa, and Madh - 55%) and N ward (Ghatkopar, Vidyavihar and Pant Nagar).

While areas such as Pydhonie, Bhuleshwar, Grant Road, Walkeshwar, Malabar Hill, Breach Candy to Haji Ali all had concrete rooftops.

WRI India's third map was a correlation of the city's green spaces and heat exposure and its implication on surface temperature. It showed over 31% of Mumbai's land area had green cover (open maidans, tree-cover, mangroves and forests, city-parks etc.) but it was concentrated only in some wards. ""There is a variation of 29 to 34 degrees Celsius across Mumbai wards, which means areas with highest green cover are five degrees cooler than those with less than 10% vegetation. Urban greening helps improve air quality, increased oxygen levels, lower ambient temperatures, and improve livability standards,"" said Rangwala.

R-Central ward (Borivli) had the highest percentage of green cover (75%) and the lowest mean temperature (29-30 degrees Celsius) followed by T-ward (Mulund) with 70% green cover and the lowest mean temperature at 29 degrees Celsius. Conversely, B ward (Masjid Bunder, Mohd. Ali Road, Dongri and Bhendi Bazar) and C ward (Pydhonie and Bhuleshwar) had less than 10% green cover and highest mean temperatures at 34 degrees Celsius.

""Combining all options under a heat action plan for Mumbai is a necessity, implemented by all stakeholders. Heat risk in cities is a problem of social equity. City governments need to support greater innovation in low-income settlements to increase vegetation, deploy sustainable and heat resilient materials for housing construction,"" said Madhav Pai, director, WRI India.

Ministerspeak

Variations in temperature are bound to be there in slum areas where there is no space for trees vis-à-vis residential zones where more green cover is present, said state environment and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray. ""However, we are working on specific plans for Mumbai and will be factoring in solutions for site-specific heat exposure as part of the Maharashtra state climate action policy. We are meeting with various state departments, and looking at what they are offering towards this policy to ensure city-specific climate resilience in Maharashtra,"" he said.

Expertspeak

The state's current climate action plan falls short of addressing the heat stress concerns, say experts. ""Without such a plan, the situation is likely to worsen annually now under the current effects of climate change, and unfortunately low-income groups would be at the forefront of the health impacts,"" said Ashok Jaswal, former scientist of the India Meteorological Department and lead author of 2017 study on decadal rise in average heat index over 60 years in India.",2020-11-20T18:33:00Z
The Times of India,Global warming may hit wheat production in long run: IIT-Delhi study - Times of India,Mohammad Ibrar,"NEW DELHI: Global increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere may lead to reduction in wheat production by the end of this century. However, the effect of CO2 on wheat production is likely to vary from one region to another, a study conducted by IIT-Delhi has found.

Scientists from IIT-Delhi, in collaboration with scientists from The University of Illinois and Indian Agricultural Research Institute, have developed a new model to study the growth processes of spring wheat, a staple food for millions in India and the world. The model has been used to study how environmental factors and land management practices have affected spring wheat production in India over the last four decades.

Published in the European journal, Earth System Dynamics, the study found out that since the 1980s, the elevated CO2 levels in the atmosphere, irrigation and nitrogen fertilisers have increased wheat production by 22 Mega Tonne (MT), which translates to a 30% rise. But at the same time, rising temperatures have reduced production by 13 MT (18%). These effects vary across the country, thereby affecting production at regional scales.

""Atmospheric CO2 and temperature have contrasting effects on the production. More CO2 in the atmosphere caused the wheat production to go up. This effect is known as CO2 fertilisation. However, more CO2 in the atmosphere also caused global warming and the increasing temperatures have had a negative effect on the wheat production,"" stated Somnath Baidya Roy of IIT-Delhi's Centre for Atmospheric Sciences.

He explained that ""in nature, there are two-three things happening simultaneously and the ultimate outcome is the net result of multiple things. The strength of our new model is that we can simulate all factors of wheat growth.""

He stated that while so far, the positive effect of increased CO2 is stronger than the negative effect of warming, some idealised experimental studies on crops in the US have suggested that the CO2 fertilisation effect is temporary and global warming will cause the production to decrease in the long run.

""If you continue to add CO2 in the atmosphere, the CO2 fertilisation will stop at some point. We will see a net negative effect by the end of this century,"" the IIT-D scientist added.

Roy stated that ""the outcomes of the paper unearthed interesting new aspects of regional variability in wheat production that can be useful for building climate change mitigation policies in the context of food security.""",2020-09-15T10:20:00Z
The Times of India,Green murder in Kukatpally: 55 trees axed for water sump | Hyderabad News - Times of India,,"HYDERABAD: The mass felling of 55 trees -- all of them at least 10-years-old -- at a gated community in Kukatpally, has left residents and environmentalists fuming. The trees were axed to make way for a water tank.

While the incident occurred in December, the matter came to light only on Saturday after a resident lodged a complaint with Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), alleging that the green cover of the complex was damaged beyond repair at the behest of the current executive committee of Indu Fortune Fields Gardenia Apartments. ""After being chopped in December, the tree stumps were left unattended till recently. There were all between 25 and 30 feet high and no permission was sought before cutting them,"" said K Dasaradhi, a resident and former president of the committee. He claimed that his repeated appeals to the current committee, to seek permission for felling as well as replacing them, fell on deaf years.

As per rulebook, all parties must procure a permission from the Tree Protection Committee, which falls under the forest department's purview, if more than five trees are to be cut or translocated.

Sreedevi Saraswati, forest range officer of Dulapally, confirmed that the department had not issued any permission to the complex for felling. The committee's claims about the trees being translocated to KBR Park were yet to be confirmed by the official. She said that her department had not given the go ahead to this either. ""We have carried out an inspection of the site and are yet to ascertain how many trees and which species have been lost. We will also visit KBR Park to assess whether the translocation was done,"" Saraswati said.

The allegations were, however, countered by Rajendra Prasad, president of Indu Fortune Fields Gardenia Apartment Owners Association, who maintained that 36 ""flowering plants"" had been successfully translocated. When asked for the permission letter, Prasad said that GHMC was consulted before the plants were cut to set up a water storage sump. ""They said these plants do not constitute trees by virtue of type of plant and the kind of girth/stem size,"" he said, adding, ""With summer approaching, we could not obtain a written permission, as the GHMC person who inspected (the premises) said that GHMC won't give that kind of permissions (sic) as these trees don't fall under their purview."" While Prasad said the translocation was carried out on February 9 and 10, the letter sent to R Shobha, principal chief conservator of forests, informing her about it is, incidentally, dated February 20 (STOI has a copy).

Environmentalist Captain J Rama Rao said that the probability of a tree stump surviving was slim, especially in current weather conditions. ""Even with adequate water, it is tough for translocated trees to survive in the summer,"" he said. His words were echoed by Subba Rao, former advisor, climate change, Engineering Staff College of India, who said, ""The lack of moisture in the soil during this season could be the final blow for the trees.""",2020-02-23T03:50:00Z

The Times of India,Treat wastage of water as a crime: Petition | Noida News - Times of India,,"Ghaziabad: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has ordered the ministry of jal shakti and Delhi Jal Board to furnish an action-taken report on water misuse and wastage after admitting a plea by Rajendra Tyagi, a BJP councillor from Ghaziabad, seeking directions to make wasting water a punishable offence.

Tyagi said he felt the need to move NGT because the aspect of household water wastage was still not getting the attention it needed even though the Prime Minister himself had called for a national effort to conserve water and turn it into a mission like Swachh Bharat.

""Even with nationwide focus on water conservation, the issue of wastage or misuse of water in households across country has been partially, if not completely, missed,"" Tyagi said. ""We have in our petition given a summary of sorts on water wastage by using data from government agencies and departments, and from authentic sources. It gives a sense of how grave the problem is.""

Tyagi's petition has listed some common habits that lead to water wastage and has cited figures. ""In using the flush, 15 to 16 litres of potable water is wasted. Leaving a tap running accounts to water wastage at the rate of 5 litres a minute. On an average, a single household wastes 20-60 litres of water in dish washing,"" Tyagi said. ""There have to be some checks and balances or a mechanism to make people accountable when there is such criminal waste of water. So, we have sought from NGT that under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 water wastage be made a punishable offence,"" he added.

Drawing a contrast with the availability of potable water in the country, Tyagi quoted figures from his petition to say around 16 crore people did not have access to fresh, drinking water and almost 60 crore people are facing extreme water stress.

His counsel in the NGT, Akash Vashishtha, said, ""The petitions seeks directions to be given to the ministries of jal shakti and environment, forests and climate change to take measures to issue directions to all states and Union territories to make wastage and misuse of water through overflowing tanks or otherwise a punishable offence. Under Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 the government can very well do it.""

The NGT has given jal shakti ministry and DJB a month to file their reports and scheduled the next hearing on August 23.",2019-07-28T01:55:00Z
The Times of India,Greens raise alarm on new Delhi-Gurgaon link roads - Times of India,Shilpy Arora,"Gurgaon: The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has finalised a proposal for two roads connecting Gurgaon and Delhi through the Aravalli Biodiversity Park after conducting a feasibility survey, according to sources.

However, environmentalists protested the move, saying the roads would come up at the cost of forest area.

NHAI initially proposed the roads -- one connecting Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road to NH-8 (Link A) and another connecting Nelson Mandela Marg in Vasant Kunj, Delhi, to the Aravalli Biodiversity Park and then going towards the Gurgaon-Faridabad Road (Link B) -- in 2016.

On Saturday, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) officials claimed that the map showing the roads, available on the NHAI website, was incorrect and their alignment was finalised only this year.

GMDA CEO V Umashankar said, ""First, the road shown as Link B is not passing through Haryana. Second, the alignment of the road shown as Link A is incorrect on the map. It is absolutely misleading.""

However, Latika Thukral from iamgurgaon, the NGO which developed the Aravali Biodiversity park over the past seven years, said, ""If officials wanted to build roads through the park, they shouldn't have carried out plantation drives here.

""Today, the park is seen as a success story and acts as a green lung of the city. Thousands of people have contributed to make this happen. Why was the forest created if it has to be destroyed?""

Vijay Dhasmana, who curated the park, said, ""If roads come up, the park will be destroyed. The park is situated on Gair Mumkin Pahar and should be protected as a forest. Besides, the 2031 master plan marks the area as a biodiversity park. The authorities even want us to take up more green projects in Gurgaon. We wonder if this is going to be the fate of all green spaces, why should we create them?""

Some environmentalists also said that authorities should be answerable for wasting public money. Vivek Kamboj from Haryali, an environmental NGO, said, ""It is ridiculous that authorities first spend taxpayers' money to carry out plantation drives and then come up with proposals to destroy the same.""

Birders also raised their concerns. ""It is the only pristine natural space in Gurgaon. Many rare bird species have started coming here and this park is their breeding area. This has happened because many native plant species of the Aravalis were brought to the park,"" said Pankaj Gupta, a birder from Delhi Bird Foundation.

However, GMDA sources insisted that the roads would ease traffic movement and would only be 60 metres wide. ""The roads will not destroy the park and can be built here only as land conversion is possible in this area. While authorities can ensure minimal impact on the environment, the road will go a long way to make the traffic situation better,"" said a senior official.

Spread over 380 acres, the park was a mining and garbage dumping site till 2010 and was given to iamgurgaon in 2011 for maintenance. The NGO conducted various plantation drives, along with corporate and citizens' groups, to develop the park. Over 1.15 lakh saplings of around 110 native species have been planted in the park.

NHAI will need environmental clearances from the ministry of environment, forest and climate change and land from MCG to go ahead with the plan.",2018-10-21T02:14:00Z
The Times of India,NGT refuses a stay on Basai waste plant - Times of India,Shilpy Arora,"GURUGRAM: The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has refused to stay the construction of a waste recycling plant in Basai wetland, in response to an application alleging that MCG doesn't have requisite approvals under the C&D waste management rules, 2016. ""We are of the considered opinion that no further order for purposes of clarification or for any other purpose is required,"" said a bench headed by Justice Raghuvendra S Rathore after the petitioner demanded an immediate stay on alleged dumping of waste near the waste treatment plant.

The NGT was hearing a plea filed by a Delhi-based NGO in June last year, seeking a stay on the C&D waste plant in Basai. The next hearing of the case is scheduled for May 30. But Pankaj Gupta from Delhi Bird Foundation claimed dumping of waste was changing the basic nature of the wetland. ""The corporation will gradually fill up the wetland and there will be nothing left to fight for,"" he told TOI.

But Sudhir Chauhan, senior town planer (MCG), said, ""We are transporting material for the development of the site. We are building pavement at the site and not merely dumping waste.""

In January, the green tribunal had lifted the stay on the construction of the waste treatment plant in Basai wetland but instructed the corporation to make sure that construction starts only after receiving all requisite permission from the departments concerned under the C&D waste management rules. In December last year, the NGT had directed the petitioner to file an application with the Haryana government to declare Basai as a wetland. Also, the Union ministry of environment, forest and climate change (MoEF & CC) pulled up the Haryana government for not taking any step to identify and classify wetlands, including Basai. However, the state government didn't list Basai as a wetland.",2018-05-21T01:50:00Z

The Times of India,AIPEF writes to Union power minister on power reforms - Times of India,Manish Sirhindi,"PATIALA: The All India Power Engineers Federation (AIPEF) in a letter to R K Singh Union Power Minister has made several suggestions on the power sector reforms including financial crisis facing the power distribution companies, electricity (amendment) bill 2014, solar power and nuclear power.

The federation has pointed out that the power supply industry is under severe financial and operational distress due to various factors. The consequences of this are spilling over to the financial institutions and capital goods industry. Solutions to the financial crisis like the UDAY scheme are merely temporary arrangements. Unless a final solution is found in respect of the securitized debt, there is a danger that the debts may be sold in the international debt market.

The financial crisis cannot be resolved unless the power purchase agreements (PPAs) are reviewed and payment for power that has not been consumed on account of the provision of fixed costs and this runs into thousands of crores of rupees. Electricity (Amendment ) Bill 2014 would accentuate the above stated financial crisis causing irreparable damage to the power supply industry.The Government of India should keep the Electricity Bill 2014 in abeyance till there is extensive consultation with all stakeholders including power engineers and employees.

The techno-economic scrutiny and mandatory approval by the Central Electricity Authority needs to be restored The experience of the addition of power generation since 2003 has created serious problems such as excess capacity and stressed and stranded assets resulting in huge non performing assets (NPAs) with Banks and damage to the indigenous manufacturing units due to imports, often with allegation of over-invoicing, of capital goods.

On nuclear power, the AIPEF has pointed out that the world over nuclear power is being discouraged and several manufacturers are becoming bankrupt. In this situation, these firms and the Governments of the country of their origin are pushing hard for India to purchase their equipment.In some of the cases, the proposed nuclear plants have unproven technologies and have not operated anywhere in the world. There is absolutely no justification for importing nuclear power plants in a nontransparent manner without adequate information in the public domain, particularly those relating to cost and basic design features.

Regarding renewable energy, there is no need for a knee-jerk reaction to climate change. India is not one of the major polluting nations and its emissions are very small on a per-capita basis. Addition of solar energy should take into consideration not merely the cost but also concerns of system operation. Large Giga Watt solar stations would require transmission that would be utilized only for a fraction of the time.",2017-12-03T11:41:00Z
The Times of India,ADB sticks to India's GDP growth estimates - Times of India,,"NEW DELHI: The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is sticking to its growth forecast for India and is optimistic that growth will pick up on the back of several factors, including an improving global economy. ""We are optimistic of India achieving 7% growth in 2017 and 7.4% in 2018.

There has been a front-loading of capital expenditure and consumption trend is being sustained and external environment is turning favourable,"" Sabyasachi Mitra, deputy country director at ADB told a news conference.

Growth is expected to slow in the current financial year as the impact of demonetisation and roll-out issues linked to GST hurt expansion.

But most economists and multilateral agencies expect growth to accelerate in the years ahead. The Manila-based multilateral agency had lowered India's growth estimates for 2017 due to the short term impact of demonetisation. The Central Statistics Office will publish the data for July-September on November 30. Growth slowed to three-year low of 5.7% in the April-June quarter, triggering criticism over the handling of the economy.

But since then a string of goods has bolstered the confidence of policymakers. Global rating agency Moody's Investor Service raised the country's sovereign rating, while India improved its position significantly in the World Bank's Ease of Doing business ranking. ADB country director Kenichi Yokoyama said the agency plans to raise its annual funding to India to $4 billion from existing $2.7 billion next year.

He said this would be done to ""accelerate inclusive economic transformation of India. ""The other priority pillars include increasing annual funding to low income states and climate change,"" he said.",2017-11-28T03:33:00Z

The IDA was set up on June 1 this year, following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's review meeting for the holistic development of islands.

Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh chaired the second meeting of the IDA here today.

It was noted that site development potential reports have clearly mapped and delineated environmentally-sensitive zones in the project islands, and considering the unique maritime and territorial bio-diversity of the islands, enhanced connectivity has been recommended as one of the key priorities, according to a press release issued by the home ministry.

Accordingly, it was decided that the Naval Air Station at Shibpur near Diglipur in northern Andaman and Nicobar Islands would be co-used as joint user airport, it said.

""During the meeting, it was also decided to develop a public-private partnership (PPP) package including a airport (joint user airport) at Minicoy Island, to unlock the tourism potential,"" the release said.

It was agreed to promote tuna fishing industry for improving livelihoods in Lakshadweep, it said.

The home minister directed all concerned to expedite implementation of ongoing key infrastructure projects in the islands and develop community-based tourism in consultation with local stakeholders, the release said.

The government think tank NITI Aayog was also asked to drive the formulation of PPP projects and proposed detailed guidelines to boost private sector participation.

Singh expressed satisfaction at the progress made since the IDA's last meeting held on July 24, when directions were given to identify and execute infrastructure and connectivity projects together with provisioning of water and electricity.

In today's meeting, the Island Development Agency reviewed the concept development plans and detailed master plans for holistic development of nine islands -- four in Andaman and Nicobar Islands (i.e. Smith, Ross, Long, Avis) and five in Lakshadweep (i.e. Minicoy, Bangaram, Thinnakara, Cheriyam, Suheli). The meeting was attended by Lt Governor of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Admiral D K Joshi, former Navy Chief (Vice Chairman of IDA); Cabinet Secretary P K Sinha; CEO of NITI Aayog Amitabh Kant; Union Home Secretary Rajiv Gauba, Secretary, Environment, Forest and Climate Change, C K Mishra; and representatives of ministries of tourism, power, defence, health, telecommunications and civil aviation.

The Times of India,Forest dept-WII mega GIB survey next month - Times of India,Vijay Pinjarkar,"Nagpur: The Maharashtra Forest Department (MFD) and the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, will launch a major survey in the state to assess status of critically endangered Great Indian Bustard (GIB).

WII has prepared a landscape map of 280 grids with each grid of 15x15 km. The survey will cover over 60,000 sqkm area in the entire state where there was record of GIBs. However, number of districts to be covered will depend on number of volunteers.

Official sources said Nagpur, Chandrapur, Solapur, Aurangabad, Nashik, and Ahmednagar districts will be taken up on top priority.

""This is for the first time such a comprehensive survey will be launched from September 25. The WII has laid grids where survey will be done with the help of vehicles. Views of farmers and locals will be recorded about the status of the birds,"" said divisional forest officer (wildlife) GK Vashishtha.

""We plan to survey 25 probable GIB sites. We are in process of selecting 30 volunteers for the project who will launch the survey separately along with our researchers,"" said WII's project coordinator Shaheer Khan.

GIB is a critically endangered species and endemic to the Indian sub-continent. From thousands its number has dwindled to globally around 300 birds in the wild in fragmented habitat in the states of Rajasthan (shared with Pakistan), Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Karnataka.

The largest population of 100-125 birds exists in Jaisalmer, Barmer, and Bikaner districts of Rajasthan. All the remaining populations number less than 35 birds each.

In Maharashtra, GIBs have been recorded in Nannaj in Solapur, Warora in Chandrapur and Umred in Nagpur districts. However, owing to habitat destruction the birds have been pushed to extinction here too.

""As global change leads to increasingly rapid habitat alteration in land use pattern and exponential human disturbance, it possesses a great challenge to conserve this magnificent bird of the grassland ecosystem,"" said Khan.

Khan added GIB is being pushed to extinction due to modernization of agricultural practices and rapid infrastructural developments. In this ever changing scenario, it is of great importance to assess the status of the remaining wild population and its habitat.

Vashishtha said till now the department used to conduct an annual GIB estimation exercise in August or September to know about its status. However, this is for the first time that such a big field survey is being launched.

Sources said the survey project is part of the ministry of environment, forest & climate change (MoEFCC) & WII, who have joined hands for setting up GIB breeding centre in Gujarat.

The Times of India,Tej Pratap gets notice from petro firm - Times of India,,"Patna: Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) has served a show-cause notice on May 29 to health and forest minister Tej Pratap Yadav to explain within 15 days the violation of a couple of norms in getting a petrol pump allotted at Anisabad bypass road in Patna.

BPCL, which allotted the petrol pump to Tej Pratap in 2011, has asked him to explain how he is carrying out the obligations of the firm, despite discharging the duty of the minister of health, minor water resources and forest department of Bihar government. The petrol pump was commissioned on February 27 this year.

The oil firm has also asked Tej Pratap to explain whether the land of the petrol pump actually belongs to him or M/S A K Infosystems Private Limited, as it has been alleged that the land was never leased out to him. A K Infosystems was incorporated on September 28, 2006 and Lalu's two daughters -- Ragini Lalu and Chanda Yadav -- are directors in the firm. The registered address of the firm is C-654, New Friends Colony, New Delhi.

BPCL claims the show-cause notice has been served on a complaint by one Chandrashekhar and others on April 28, wherein it has been alleged that Tej Pratap had falsely declared in his application that he had the land for the retail petroleum outlet, whereas its real owner was M/S A K Infosystems, which never leased out the land to him.

The oil company has stated that since Tej Pratap is discharging his duties as a minister in Bihar, allotment of retail petroleum outlet in his name may amount to violation of clause 10 (t) and other selection guidelines. The petroleum firm has stated that action might be taken, including termination of the dealership, if genuine explanation is not given with respect to the complaint.

BJP's leader of opposition Sushil Kumar Modi, on May 5 alleged that Tej Pratap did not have the 43 decimal of land mentioned in his application for setting up the petrol pump.

This is the second incidence of a central government agency taking action on complaints filed against the properties of Lalu clan in Bihar. Union ministry of forest, environment and climate change on May 17 issued an order to stop all the ongoing works on Delite Mall being developed on the land owned by Lara Projects Limited Liability Partnership, an alleged shell firm run by Lalu's family.

The Times of India,Mining belt sees up in air quality - Times of India,Murari Shetye,"Panaji: While stating that the air quality index (AQI) has significantly improved in the mining belt post 2012, the Goa State Pollution Control Board (GSPCB) report recommended the prohibition of iron ore transportation during busy hours, as recommended by the Indian School of Mines (ISM), Dhanbad, to maintain the current AQI.

The board had recently conducted ambient air monitoring in mining areas to ascertain AQI. Its report has been published in the Mines Safety Council souvenir.

When mining was on, the AQI in the study area was found to be moderatein the range of 101 to 200as per norms laid down by the Central Pollution Control Board. The AQI after mining operations ceased was found to be satisfactory in the non-monsoon season and good in the monsoon season.

""Mining operations restarted in 2015-16 with a cap of 20 million tonnes per annum (MTPA). To ensure the AQI is maintained, the effective management plan, as recommended by ISM, Dhanbad, with strict enforcement of load limit and vehicle speed should be ensured. Similarly, transportation of ore should be prohibited during busy hours, as recommended,"" the GSPCB report stated.

Sources said the board collects air quality data twice a week from different locations in the mining belt to check the AQI. The report was prepared based on the data collected from mining areas such as Curchorem, Bicholim, Assonora and Honda.

Recently, the ministry of environment, forest and climate change sought comments from state and central departments over increasing the ore extraction cap in the state to 37 MTPA as per the report prepared by the six-member expert committee appointed by the Supreme Court.

The Times of India,'Manjha' menace: Ban will make Makar Sankranti safer this year - Times of India,,"JAIPUR: The National Green Tribunal's (NGT) nationwide interim ban on the procurement, sale and use of glass powder-coated 'manjha' and other dangerous kite strings on Wednesday has come well in time before 'Makar Sankranti'. Every year, many human lives besides that of avian species are lost due to glass-coated Chinese 'manjha' used to fly kites in the city.

The NGT bench, headed by chairman Justice Swatanter Kumar, passed the interim ban order on the use of nylon threads, called Chinese 'manjha,' as well as synthetic/cotton threads coated with glass powder or other hazardous compounds until the next hearing on February 1, 2017.

A PIL was filed in the Supreme Court seeking a nationwide ban on these strings used to fly kites which led to the death of 50 people in two years. The SC had asked the petitioners to approach the NGT.

The NGT had also admitted a petition filed by the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), India, and issued a notice to the Central government to respond to the petitioner's plea on the ban on 'manjha'.

""'Manjha' is a menace. It poses a life-threatening risk to humans and birds, damages the country's infrastructure, and hinders essential services such as electricity. The NGT's decision will be welcomed by the general public and bird lovers as it would ensure that kite flying is an enjoyable and safe affair during 'Makar Sankranti.' Those flying kites can use plain cotton thread,"" said Nikunj Sharma of PETA.

In Rajasthan, despite a ban on Chinese 'manjha,' the use of these killer strings was rampant during the festival last year. A 7-year-old boy in Bassi died when the Chinese 'manjha' slashed his throat. He was riding a bike along with his father.

Besides, the administration had to even halt the Metro, though only for a few seconds, after a string tripped power supply. More than 100 birds were injured by the deadly kite string in the city. During celebrations on the first day of 'Sankranti,' at least 80 people, mostly children, were injured in kite flying-related accidents in Jaipur city.

The bench said the glass powder-coated strings not only posed a threat to birds, animals and humans, but also harmed the environment. The order came in response to a petition filed by PETA, which wanted a nationwide ban on all types of dangerous kite strings.

Reacting to the NGT order, PETA said the interim ban would save many lives as it has come a month before the festival.

The petition was filed in August. The tribunal then issued notices to all state governments, the ministries of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC), home affairs, commerce and industry, and Power and sought their responses.

New Delhi, Oct 3 () Multilateral lending agency Asian Development Bank (ADB) today said it will extend a USD 200 million loan to India for installation of energy-efficient home and street lights, and water pumps.

The entire exercise could save energy to the tune of 3,800 gigawatt-hours per year.

""Energy efficiency is by far the least costly option to ensure or expand energy access while still cutting deadly greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants,"" ADB said in a statement, quoting Director General of ADB's South Asia Regional Department, Hun Kim.

""With India one of the world's largest and fastest-growing economies, getting the country firmly on a path of low-carbon growth will have an impact not only at home but for the rest of the world too,"" Kim added.

The statement said ADB will provide the funds to Energy Efficiency Services Ltd (EESL), a joint venture between four public sector bodies - the National Thermal Power Corporation, Powergrid Corporation of India, Power Finance Corporation, and Rural Electrification Corporation - established in 2009.

""EESL will use the ADB funds, alongside another USD 200 million of its own, to finance energy service activities, which often have trouble accessing commercial finance for energy-saving projects,"" it added.

EESL will make loans available for installing light-emitting diode (LED) municipal streetlights, energy-efficient domestic lights and fans, and energy-efficient agriculture water pumps.

The entire USD 400 million project will install 1.5 million LED street lamps, 42 million LED household lamps, ceiling fans and LED tube lights, and 225,000 new pumps. Lending will be made available in Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Telangana, and Uttar Pradesh, as well as other states going forward, the statement said.

The Manila headquartered agency said it hopes the success of these sub-projects will attract more investment into energy efficiency.

""EESL has an ambitious longer-term target of installing 4.5 million streetlights, 700 million LED bulbs, and 6 million energy-efficient pumps by 2020 that would require investment of more than USD 12 billion,"" ADB noted. Under the recently agreed Paris climate agreement, India has committed to cutting the energy intensity of its economy by 33 per cent from 2005 levels by 2030. (MORE) BKS JM",2016-10-03T12:29:00Z
The Times of India,NITI Aayog to unveil National Energy Policy in 3 months - Times of India,,"New Delhi, Aug 5 () NITI Aayog is likely to unveil the new National Energy Policy in the next three months with a focus on air quality issue, renewable energy, natural gas, universal electrification and clean cooking fuel.

The policy will replace Integrated Energy Policy that envisioned a road map for sustainable growth with energy security over a reasonable period of time. It was approved by the Union Cabinet in December 2008 during UPA regime.

""The work on National Energy Policy is in advance stages. NITI Aayog would be able to bring out the policy in 10-12 weeks,"" a senior official said.

The official said,""The policy will replace the earlier Integrated Energy Policy. In addition to the areas covered under the existing policy, the new document will focus on air quality issue, renewable energy, natural gas, universal electrification and clean cooking fuel.""

""Earlier policy did not cover natural gas exhaustively as the prices were very high in 2006-07. Secondly, the government is pushing renewables which would be covered under this. Since the government wants to provide electricity and clean cooking fuel to all. It will provide an outlook on these subjects,"" he said.

The official also said that the policy will also make a case of ""polluter pays"" in view of deteriorating air quality, industrial emission and vehicular pollution.

The new policy will also incorporate energy modelling, which in other words is computerised simulation of a building or complex that focuses on energy consumption, utility bills and life cycle costs of various energy related items.

It is also used to evaluate 'payback' of green energy solutions like solar panels and photovoltaics, wind turbines and high efficiency appliances.

NITI Aayog is also working on a platform that will host all the data related to energy sector in the country including oil & gas, coal, solar & thermal energy etc.

The official said that it will take three to four years to develop this New Energy Data Agency. Aayog is in the process of inking a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with US Energy Information Administration (EIA) for this purpose.

In its run up to unveiling detailed road map for country's energy security, NITI Aayog is organising National Conference On Energy Data: Management, Modelling and GIS Mapping on next Wednesday.

During the conference, US Ambassador and UK High Commissioner will talk about India's collaborations with USAID and Department of Energy & Climate Change (UK). Aayog is also working on geospatial map related to energy infrastructure to boost renewable sources. RNK KKS BAL MKJ",2016-08-05T13:43:00Z

Stating that the state government has planned for plantation of one crore sapling, Singh said Jharkhand is endowed with abundant greenery and rules should be implemented sternly to preserve it.

Chief Secretary Raj Bala Verma pitched for 'jan andolan' (people's movement) to protect the environment, connecting everyone.

Under the 'Namami Gange' programme, she said plantation work would begin along five of the 83 km-stretch along Sahibganj and Raj Mahal this fiscal.

Principal Secretary of Forest, Environment and Climate Change Sukhdeo Singh said 950 square km forest has increased since the state's creation. He said earlier plantations were done in forest areas while now it has also been decided to cover non-forest areas and Rs 70 crore has been marked under the 'Jan Van programme' for roadside and institutional plantations.

The Times of India,Successful mission to India on Trade-Led Growth concluded by USIBC - Times of India,,"New Delhi, April 11 (ANI): The US-India Business Council (USIBC) fielded a delegation of senior executives to New Delhi, India, to meet with government officials and key stakeholders to discuss trade and investment-led growth strategies.

The delegation was led by Ambassador Frank G. Wisner, former US Ambassador to India and International Affairs Advisor, Squire Patton Boggs. Other members of the delegation included the Kenneth I. Juster, Partner and Managing Director, Warburg Pincus; Nelson Cunningham, President and Cofounder, McLarty Associates; Ambassador Teresita Schaffer, Senior Advisor, McLarty Associates; S. Vijay Iyer, Managing Director, Rio Tinto; and Mukesh Aghi, President, US-India Business Council.

The delegation discussed the Government of India's economic priorities with senior officials across various ministries and the active role that the United States could play in stimulating growth, trade, investment, and jobs.

The delegation was also received by the India Foundation and participated in a roundtable discussion on trade organized by the Ananta Institute, and in the Growth Net Summit.

The delegates shared their thoughts on the importance of trade-led growth in powering the economic expansion of emerging markets around the world. The USIBC envoys were keen to understand the challenges that India's trade policy faces at a time of global economic turbulence, acknowledging that the US too faces similar hurdles. The delegates observed that expanding trade, investment, and employment are all concomitant, and the goals should be pursued simultaneously.

The delegation also reiterated that two measures in particular should be considered as primary avenues to achieve the above objectives: exploring India's membership in APEC, which could be a stepping stone toward participation in broader regional trade pacts, and negotiating a bilateral investment treaty (BIT) with the United States. USIBC would welcome an Indian decision to pursue membership in the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP).

""A strong trade strategy is a sound national security policy as well, and can contribute to expanding investment and employment,"" said Ambassador Frank Wisner, of Squire Patton Boggs.

""Americans are happy to see India's rise to the global high table. The assertion of Indian leadership on climate change and nuclear safety and security are welcome initiatives. We look forward to similar Indian leadership in developing policy aimed at trade and investment,"" Frank Wisner.

USIBC President Mukesh Aghi noted, ""India's exploration of APEC membership, which is potentially an informal precursor to Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) membership, could unlock India's potential as a global manufacturing hub and deepen its ties with the global economy.""

The Times of India,IMD to launch maiden city-wise heat forecast - Times of India,Vishwa Mohan,"New Delhi: India Meteorological Department (IMD) will for the first time come out with a temperature outlook for the summer season, and forecast city- and town-wise heat conditions like it does for rainfall and cyclones.

The summer temperature outlook, comprising an early warning system for heatwaves and specific advisories, is to be released this month-end and will be valid for the April-June period. An extended range forecast (up to 15 days) of summer temperatures with a five-day update will be part of this exercise.

It is expected that IMD, along with Earth System Science Organisation (ESSO), will come out with a temperature outlook covering as many as 100 cities/towns.

""Though we have been issuing general advisories (for heatwave) for years, we are now in a position to come out with specific city-wise advisory. It will help local governments and civic bodies take precautionary measures in advance and protect local communities from the heat wave,"" said L S Rathore, director general of IMD. The death of over 2,300 people due to heat wave across India last year prompted IMD to come out with the outlook and specific advisory.

Rathore told TOI that his department was working with local IMD offices, civic authorities and NGOs in key cities to ensure that its forecast tools could help advance adaptation efforts when climate change increases temperature and the frequency and severity of heat wave.

State governments are, meanwhile, gearing up with their respectiveheat preparedness action plans which will be in sync with IMD's early warning system.",2016-03-13T21:33:00Z
